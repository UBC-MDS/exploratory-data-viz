Notes: 
1. Describe the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning  
2. Distinguish machine learning terminology such as features, targets, training, error, etc.
3. Broadly describe how the decision tree algorithm works
4. Develop a decision tree model using scikit-learn and the fit/predict paradigm
5. Describe the difference between parameters and hyperparameters in machine learning models

# Supervised Learning 

- In supervised learning, we have a set of observations (__*X*__) with an associated response (__*y*__)
- We wish to find a model function that relates __*X*__ to __*y*__
- Then use that model function to predict future observations

Goal	of	supervised	learning:	
â€“ Use	data	to	find	a	model	that	outputs	the	right	label	based	on	the	features.

See the magic in practice...

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import sys
sys.path.append('code/')
from toy_classifier import classify_image

img = Image.open("alpaca.jpg")
img
```

```out

## Unsupervised learning
- We have data, but no associated response
- We will not be covering unsupervised learning in this course and instead put our main focus on supervised
