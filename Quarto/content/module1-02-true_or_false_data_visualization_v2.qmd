*It is easier for humans to interpret plots than raw numbers.*

::::{.choices}

:::{.choice}
True

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
False

:::::

::: {.callout-tip title="Answer" collapse="true"}
The right answer is **"True"**: We saw in the slides that sometimes humans can pick up more information about the data in plots.<br>
If you got this wrong: Take a look at the slides. Is it easier to notice trends and patterns with the data displayed in tables or in plots?

**True or False**<br>

:::::{.question}

:::{.choice .correct-choice}
False

:::::

::: {.callout-tip title="Answer" collapse="true"}
The right answer is **"True"**.<br>
If you got this wrong: Summaries are helpful but donâ€™t get us a full picture like a visualization can.
