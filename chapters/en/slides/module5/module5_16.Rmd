# Effective use of color for quantitative data

Notes:
This slide deck describes how to choose color to accurately represent numerical data.

---

## Repetition of hue, lightness, and saturation

<center><img src="/module5/hsl-questions.png" width="50%"></img></center>

Notes:
In the last slide deck we varied hues to represent categorical values,
with a focus on the distinction between color hues/categories.
When choosing a color scheme to represent quantitative data,
we will instead focus on sequential, perceptually uniform changes in lightness.

Sequential changes in lightness ensures that uniform changes in the values of the data
are perceived as uniform changes in the color space.
In other words,
we want it to be intuitive 
how the colors relate the numerical values they represent,
so that we can accurately understand how the data values vary
when looking at the changing colors.

---

## Lightness is more effective than hue to communicate changes in quantitative data

```{python}
# TODO hide code
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()
chart = alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=50, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Origin', title=None))
((chart.encode(alt.Color('Horsepower', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='tableau10')))
| chart.encode(alt.Color('Horsepower')))
 .resolve_scale(color='independent'))
```

Notes:
In the plots on this slide,
we have encoded the same variable (Horsepower) to be represented by both the x-axis and the color.
This is rarely done in practice,
but it is useful to contrast and understand color schemes
because we know that the colors of the points should change in a perceptually uniform manner
as we move from left to right along the x-axis.

In the leftmost plot in this slide we used the default categorical color scheme.
As you can see this is not at all well suited to represent numerical data
as the sharp transitions between hues makes it appear as if there are groups in the data,
whereas we know that these values are changing gradually from left to right on the x-axis.

In the plot to the right,
we have used the default sequential color scheme for quantitative data in Altair.
This conveys the gradual change in the Horsepower values in a perceptually uniform manner.
We can clearly see that color is changing gradually from light to dark along the x-axis,
although it can be hard to pinpoint exactly which number a particular color is
(remember that color is not as good as position to convey an exact value
even when it is easy to see the overall trend).

---

## Combining lightness variation with a slight variation in hue highlights detail in the data

```{python}
# TODO hide code
((chart.encode(alt.Color('Horsepower'))
| chart.encode(alt.Color('Horsepower', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='viridis', reverse=True))))
 .resolve_scale(color='independent'))
```

Notes:
The leftmost plot here uses the same default color scheme as in the previous slide.

The plot on the right has a color scheme that adds a slight variation in hue
while keeping the perceptually uniform variation in lightness.

The reason for this is to highlight small variations in the data
when this is of great importance. 
We can see the effect of this buy studying the values in the 60-80 range in both plots.
It is hard to see the differences between these in the leftmost plot,
but thanks to the hue transition from yellow to green in the rightmost plot
we can more clearly perceive detail in this range.

Although the hue shifts in this plots are more gradual
than in the plot with the categorical color scheme in the previous slide,
it may still introduce a slight bias towards seeing groupings where there are none,
which is something to keep in mind.

In practice,
both of these color schemes are used often to represent quantitative data.

---

## High values should have the most contrast to the background

```{python}
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=50, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Horsepower', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='viridis', reverse=True)))
```

Notes:
To decide whether the highest or lowest values
should be at the lightest or darkest end of a sequential color schemes,
it is advisable to set it so that the most important values
has the most contrast to the background.

Often there is no difference in importance between high and low values;
then the convention is to set the highest values
to have the most contrast with the background,
which is the case for most Altair color schemes by default.

However,
for the "viridis" color scheme that we are using here,
goes from dark to light by default
so we need to pass `reverse=True` to `alt.Scale`
(this technique could be used to reverse any scale in Altair,
including the value along one of the axes).

The viridis color scheme was designed by the developers of matplotlib (another Python plotting package).
In addition to the color schemes linked in the previous slide deck,
more details and examples are available in the [matplotlib documentation],
and many of the core design principles are outlined in [this entertaining talk],
including the design choice behind viridis.

## Some color schemes are designed specifically for people with color vision deficiencies

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=50, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Horsepower', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='cividis', reverse=True)))
```

Notes:
Both viridis, the default blue color scheme,
and most of the quantitative color schemes available in Altair
are well perceived by people with color vision deficiencies 
since the data variation is mostly represented as variation in lightness.

However,
there are also some color schemes that are designed to look almost exactly the same
for people with the most common color vision deficiences
also when it comes to the hue variation.

`'cividis'` is one of these color schemes and you can see how it looks in this plot.

Nearly 10% of the population is colour vision deficient;
red-green colour blindness in particular affects 8% of men and 0.5% of women.
Guidelines for making your visualizations more accessible to those with reduced color vision,
will in many cases also improve the interpretability of your graphs
for people who have standard color vision.

Fortunately,
many of these are followed by the default settings in Altair,
and we don't need to change the color scheme for this reason.

If you are unsure how your plot will look for someone who sees colors differently than you,
[this website lets you upload and image and simulate different color vision deficiencies](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).

## Additional hue variation brings out further detail, but distorts the perceptual uniformity

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=50, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Horsepower', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='turbo')))
```

<!-- #region -->
Notes:
If minor variation in the data is of uttermost importance,
it is possible to use sequential color schemes with additional hues.

In this plot,
we use a modern rainbow color scheme to highlight small changes in the Horsepower variable.
While both the previous color schemes were gradually increasing in lightness,
this is not the case for this rainbow map.

Here the lightest colors are in the middle and the darkest at both extremes of the color schemes.
This is particularly a negative for people with color vision deficiencies,
which can no longer rely on the gradual lightness change
and the varying hues therefore make this plot less accessible.

In addition to losing the overall intuitiveness of the color scheme,
the many hues mean that we’re likely
to perceive changes in the color in a non-uniform manner,
and see groups where they are none.

Importantly,
the rainbow map we have used here is a modern color scheme called “turbo”,
which was recently developed by Google.
Most rainbow color schemes you will see on plots in the wild use a color scheme called “jet”,
which used to be the default in many plotting packages
but is not a good choice for any data,
because it introduces artificial banding and highlighting of values.

The take home message here is that there are valid use cases for modern rainbow maps,
but you should be confident that there is no better alternative before reaching for this tool,
and be careful when interpreting rainbow colored plots in general.


The jet rainbow colormap should be avoided for many reasons,
including that the sharp transitions between colors introduces visual threshold
that do not represent the underlying continuous data.
Another issue is luminance (brightness).
For example,
your eye is drawn to the yellow and cyan regions,
because the luminance is higher.
This can have the unfortunate effect of highlighting features in your data
that don't exist,
misleading your viewers!
Since higher values are not always lighter,
this means that your graph is not going to translate well to greyscale.
More details about jet can be found in [this blog post] and [this series of posts].
A better alternative when you really need small differences in your data to stand out
is to use the [turbo rainbow color scheme](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html).

## Diverging color schemes are suitable for plots with a natural midpoint.

<center><img src=/module5/color-schemes-lightness.png width=70%></img></center>

Notes:
In this slide,
you see the lightness variation among all the color schemes we have covered.
Categorical colors are discretely separated,
perceptually uniform color schemes vary lightness linearly throughout the range,
whereas rainbow maps
peak lightness in the middle and have dark colors at the extremes.

The color scheme to the far right is called a diverging color scheme,
which are useful when there is a natural midpoint in the data
as we will see next.

There is also one other type of color scheme,
cyclical,
which starts and ends in both the same lightness and hue.
This design is useful for values with natural cycles
such as degrees of an angle of month of the year,
where the end and beginning are close to each other.

TODO technically this is the wrong blue, the vega one is completely stright I belive

## Temperature data can be represented with a sequential color scheme
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python}
import pandas as pd


toronto_temp = pd.read_csv('weatherstats_toronto_daily.csv', parse_dates=['date'])[['date', 'avg_temperature']]
alt.Chart(toronto_temp).mark_point().encode(
    x='date',
    y='avg_temperature',
    color=alt.Color('avg_temperature'))
```

Notes:
Examples of data that is effectively represented by diverging color schemes 
include temperature, correlations, and differences,
where zero often can be a natural midpoint.

Here we are plotting data from the last few years
of the average daily temperature (C) in Toronto, Canada
[downloaded from weatherstats.ca](https://toronto.weatherstats.ca/download.html).

As you can see,
a sequential color scheme can be used to visualize this data,
but it does not get a good sense
for when the temperature was negative
and when it was positive.

---

## A diverging colorscheme effectively highlights values at the extreme temperatures

```{python}
alt.Chart(toronto_temp).mark_point().encode(
    x='date',
    y='avg_temperature',
    color=alt.Color('avg_temperature', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='blueorange', domainMid=0)))
```

Notes:
When using a diverging colors scheme as in this slide,
it is clear which days had the extreme negative 
and the extreme positive temperatures.

This is because diverging color schemes vary in lightness
from dark at the extremes to light in the middle,
and use different hues for values on each side of the midpoint.

By default the midpoint would be set in the middle of the max and min values in our data
(so around +5 here).
Since 0 is a natural midpoint,
we specify this manually.

The default diverging coor scheme uses orange and blue hues,
but there are many other effective combinations.
You should avoid using green and red,
because these are practically impossible to tell apart
for people with the most common types of color vision deficiencies.

---

## An explicit domain can be defined to adjust colors at the extremes

```{python}
alt.Chart(toronto_temp).mark_point().encode(
    x='date',
    y='avg_temperature',
    color=alt.Color('avg_temperature', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='blueorange', domain=[-30, 30])))
```

Notes:
When setting the midpoint of the diverging color scheme,
the extremes data values on either side are given the darkest lightness values.

This means that the positive side of the scale is longer,
and only points 30 degrees away from the midpoint
are colored in the darkest orange color,

On the other hand,
for the negative values it is sufficient
to be only 20 degrees away from the midpoint
to be color in the darkest blue color.

This coloring strategy is often effective,
but it is also possible for us to set the explicit domain
over which the colors are defined,
so that points as many steps on either side of the midpoint
are assigned the same lightness values.

For temperature data,
either approach is fine and it depends on what we want to highlight.

For correlation data,
which can never be over 1 or under -1,
it would more often than not be sensible
to set these limits as the domain values.
