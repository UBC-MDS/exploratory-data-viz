# Effective figures for communication

Notes:
So far we have learned how to understand Altair's visualization grammar,
how to create several different types of plots,
and how to use these when exploring data on our own.

In this module, we will learn the principles of effective figure design for communication
and see how we can implement these using Altair.

## Figure design allows us to tell different stories from the same data

Notes:
When designing figures for presentation,
we have the possibility to tell different stories 
from the same underlying data.

On this slide,
you can see an award-winning figure describing the "bloody toll" from the American war in Iraq.
This figure has been purposely designed to draw your attention to the blood-like red colour
and the downward-facing bars which brings up an association with dripping blood.

The title also clearly highlights the negative aspects of this data.

Now let's look at another figure of the same data.

## Figure design allows us to tell different stories from the same data

[From Infoworld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3088166/why-how-to-lie-with-statistics-did-us-a-disservice.html)

<center><img src="/module5/iraq-death-on-the-decline.png" width="35%"></img></center>

Notes:
This figure paints an entirely different picture of the event.
It focuses on the recent declining trend in deaths,
uses a positive green colour,
and has the bars facing upwards.

Both figures are correct and both use the same data,
but they convey starkly distinct messages.

This also serves to illustrate that understanding the principles behind designing figures for communication
does not only help you create effective visualizations,
it is also of great help when interpreting figures made by others.

## Figure design should be adopted to the target audience and situation

[From Kieran Healy's Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata)

<center><img src="/module5/napoleon.png" width="85%"></img></center>

Notes:
This is an elegant figure
that goes into exquisite detail
about how Napoleon's army gradually shrank in numbers as the march against the Russian empire
in the early 1800s.

The width of the line is the number of soldiers in the army
and the colour represents whether they are marching against Moscow (gold/brown)
or retreating back to France (black).
The bottom of the chart shows how the temperature changed during the campaign.

It does take a few seconds to digest the graph when you first see it,
but once you have familiarised yourself with it,
you appreciate how you can see in detail the army's progress as it moved through Europe.

This is a great visualization when the reader has time to sit down with the plot for a while
and when you believe your target audience will appreciate this level of detail?

But what if you are presenting this as part of a slide deck in a board meeting
and only can spend a few seconds describing the plot?
It would likely be too complicated to digest and the take-home message might be lost.

## Figure design should be adopted to the target audience and situation

[From Kieran Healy's Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata)

<center><img src="/module5/napoleon-pie.png" width="50%"></img></center>

Notes:
In the board meeting,
this pie chart is likely more effective in communicating the take-home message:
the Napolean army was decimated as a result of this military campaign.

Although we said earlier in this course
that we should generally avoid using pie charts,
here the information is simple enough
that a pie chart is very effective.

## Breaking an axis is often misleading

[From The Economist](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368)

<center><img src="/module5/broken-axis.png" width="70%"></img></center>

Notes:
In this module, we will also visit a few best practices in visualization design
and learn why they are effective.

We can see one of these on this slide.
Breaking the value axis of a chart can lead to that the differences between the values look much bigger than they are.

In the left chart of this slide, the value axis is broken
resulting in the top bar being only 1.5x longer
than the second-longest bar
when the difference is in fact more than 5x
as can be seen in the right-most chart.

This example is from [an article in The Economist
where they critique their past visualization mistakes](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368),
which is an effective way to learn.

## Appropriate choice of colours makes visualizations much more effective

<iframe src="/module5/charts/lightness-vs-hues.html" width="100%" height="420px" style="border:none;"></iframe>

Notes:
On this slide, we have represented the values of one of the dataframe columns with different colour combinations.
Using the correct colour combination might at first seem like a matter of aesthetics rather than an important part of data visualization,
but it can have a profound impact on how we interpret plots.

Without knowing the details of how the colour combinations in this slide were created
or even what makes for a good combination of colours,
we can immediately see that it is easier to interpret the plot on the right.

Having the slight variation from light to dark blue
is a more natural mapping for a range of values
compared to the wide array of different colours used in the left plot.

We will learn why this is in a few slide decks!

## Descriptive figure and axis titles are critical for effective visualizations

<center><img src="/module5/iraqs-bloody-toll-without-title.png" width="35%"></img></center>

Notes:
This is the same figure we showed on the first slide,
but with one small modification,
can you see what it is?

What we have done is removed the title
from the top of the figure.
This relatively small change makes the figure much less striking.

While the graphics still stand out,
we're not hit with a powerful take-home message
immediately when we look at the plot.

Even if our audience would have the time to study this figure in detail
and read all the text,
it will likely not be as memorable
without the striking title.

Later in this module, we will learn not just how to create effective figure titles
but also how to label our axes effectively.

## Including many categories in pie charts makes them hard to interpret

https://github.com/glosophy/CatoDataVizGuidelines/blob/master/PocketStyleBook.pdf

<center><img src="/module5/pie-bar-categories.png" width="70%"></img></center>

Notes:
When there are too many categories in a pie chart,
it becomes difficult to compare them with each other.
Both because the colours can be hard to distinguish
and because the angle and area of the pie slices is not 

In most cases,
it is more effective to use position
as the visual channel to convey a comparison
instead area and angle.

A bar chart is often a superior alternative to a pie chart,
and when in doubt chose the bar chart for counts, percentages, and proportions.

## Breaking an axis is often misleading

https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368


Notes:
TODO what should this recommendation be exactly, it is preferred to never break, but OK as long as we use points instead of bars (where the area doesn't matter)? Is log better? Most of us don't have any intuition for log plots so it would still be "misleading".

TODO these sections below should go somewhere, but it is a bit much to have them all on one slide.

You can learn more about the difference between designing [figures for communication versus for exploration 
in this section of the book Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/choosing-visualization-software.html#data-exploration-versus-data-presentation).

It is important to remember that many of these are guidelines
and there are times when you can break such guidelines,
e.g. using different colours than the good defaults
if they already have a pre-association such as for fruits, or political parties.
[This article discusses a few more cases where breaking a guideline worked well](https://medium.economist.com/why-you-sometimes-need-to-break-the-rules-in-data-viz-4d8ece284919),
although it is not always the case that they gained a lot (such as the 3D ice cubes),
at least breaking the guideline without ruining the viz,
and having something different that stands out could be important to make a visualization more memorable.
