# Effective figures for communication

Notes:
So far we have learned how to understand Altair's visualization grammar,
how to create several different types of plots,
and how to use these when exploring data on our own.

In this module we will learn the principles of effective figure design for communication
and see how we can implement these using Altair.

## Figure design allows us to tell different stories from the same data

Notes:
When designing figures for presentation,
we have the possibility to tell different stories 
from the same underlying data.

On this slide,
you can see an award winning figure describing the "bloody toll" from the American war in Iraq.
This figure has been purposely designed to draw your attention to the blood-like red color
and the downward facing bars which brings up association with dripping blood.

The title also clearly highlights the negative aspects of this data.

Now let's look at another figure of the same data.

Notes:
This figure paints an entirely different picture of the event.
It focuses on the recent declining trend in deaths,
uses a positive green color,
and has the bars facing upwards.

Both figures are correct and both use the same data,
but they convey starkly distinct messages.

This also serves to illustrate that understanding the principles behind designing figures for communication
does not only help you create effective visualizations,
it is also of great help when interpreting figures made by others.

## Figure design should be adopted to the target audience and situation

[From Kieran Healy's Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata)

<center><img src="/module5/napoleon.png" width="100%"></img></center>

Notes:
This is an elegant figure
that goes into excquisite detail
about how Napoleon's army gradually shrank in numbers as the march against the Russian empire
in the early 1800s.

The width of the line is the number of soldiers in the army
and the color represents whether the are marching against Moscow (gold/brown)
or retreating back to France (black).
The bottom of the chart shows how the temperature changed during the campaign.

It does take a few seconds to digest the graph when you first see it,
but once you have familiarized yourself with it,
you appreciate how you can see in detail the army progress as it moved through Europe.

This is a great visualization when the reader has time to sit down with the plot for a while
and when you believe your target audience will appreciate this level of detail?

But what if you are presenting this as part of a slide deck in a board meeting
and only can spend a few seconds describing the plot?
It would likely be too complicated to digest and the take home message might be lost.

## Figure design should be adopted to the target audience and situation

[From Kieran Healy's Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata)

<center><img src="/module5/napoleon-pie.png" width="50%"></img></center>

Notes:
In the board meeting,
this pie chart is likely more effective in communicating the take home message:
the Napolean army was decimated as a result of this military campaign.

Although we said earlier in this course
that we should generally avoid using pie charts,
here the information is simple enough
that a pie chart is very effective.

# Let's apply what we learned!

## Including many categories in pie charts makes them hard to interpret

https://github.com/glosophy/CatoDataVizGuidelines/blob/master/PocketStyleBook.pdf

<center><img src="/module5/pie-bar-categories.png" width="70%"></img></center>

Notes:
When there are too many categories in a pie chart,
it becomes difficult to compare them with each other.
Both because the colors can be hard to distinguish
and because the angle and area of the pie slices is not 

In most cases,
it is more effective to use position
as the visual channel to convey a comparison
instead area and angle.

A bar chart is often a superior alternative to a pie chart,
and when in doubt chose the bar chart for counts, percentages, and proportions.

## Breaking an axis is often misleading

https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368

<center><img src="/module5/broken-axis.png" width="70%"></img></center>

Notes:
TODO what shoud this recommedation be exactly, it is preferred to never break, but OK as long as we use points instead of bars (where the area doesn't matter)? Is log better? Most of us don't have any intuition for log plots so it would still be "misleading".

TODO these sections below should go somewhere, but it is a bit much to have them all at one slide.

In addition to following guidelines
Another good way to learn is from other people's mistakes.
[Here the economist criticizes their own plots including the one in this slide](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368).

You can learn more about the difference between designing [figures for communication versus for exploration 
in this section of the book Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/choosing-visualization-software.html#data-exploration-versus-data-presentation).

It is important to remember that many of these are guidelines
and there are times when you can break such guidelines,
e.g. using different colors than the good defaults
if they already have a pre-association such as for fruits, or political parties.
[This article discusses a few more cases where breaking a guideline worked well](https://medium.economist.com/why-you-sometimes-need-to-break-the-rules-in-data-viz-4d8ece284919),
although it is not always the case that they gained a lot (such as the 3D ice cubes),
at least breaking the guideline without ruining the viz,
and having something different that stands out could be important to make a visualization more memorable.
