# Effective use of color for categorical data

Notes:
In this slide deck you will learn how to select colors that accurately represents your data
and effectively communicate it to the reader.

---

## Color choices can have profound impact on the interpretation of the results

![](/module5/color-importance-vessels.png)

Notes:
In module 2 we discussed how changing the colorscheme drastically improved a clinical outcome
by almost doubling physician's detection rate of blodd vessles regions indicative of potential future heart disease 
(from 40% to 70%).

In this slide deck we will discuss some of the consideration
that goes into evaluating if a colorscheme (also called a colormap)
is suitable for the data you are visualizing.

---

## Color can be broken down into hue, lightness, and saturation

<center><img src="/module5/hsl-cylinder.png" width="100%"></img></center>

Notes:
There are several different ways to represent colors.
You might arleady have heard of RGB (red, green, blue) or CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black)
where different amount of a set of base colors are combined to create all possible colors.

When discussing colors in the context of data visualization,
We will be describing them with the parameters "hue", "saturation" and "lightness".

The left schematic in this slide is a 2D circular representation including only hue and saturation.
When we add lightness this circle grows into cylinder with lightness as the height.

On the next slide we will break down exactly what each of these three parameters represent.

---

## Hue, lightness, and saturation describes different properties of colors

<center><img src="/module5/hsl-questions.png" width="100%"></img></center>

We could verbalize the changes we saw in the previous slide in the following manner:

Hue is what we traditionally think of as the “color”, is it red, blue, etc?

Each hue can have a varying saturation, which ranges from a dull, greyish appearance to a vibrant fully saturated hue.

Lightness is how bright the color is. For every hue, it starts at black (no lightness) and ends at white (full lightness).

Hue and lightness are the most important from a data visualization perspective,
and we use them for categorical and quantitative data, respectively. 

Saturation is often used more as a stylistic choice
to decide whether the colors we use should be muted/desaturated or vivid/saturated.

## Hues are used to distinguish categorical values

```{python}
# This code cell should be hidden but echo=False does not work with the knitr output hook
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data


cars = data.cars()
chart = alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=50, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Origin', title=None))

(chart | chart.encode(alt.Color('Origin', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='blues'), title=None))).resolve_scale(color='independent')
```

Notes:
Hue is useful to distinguish between categories,
because it is often relatively easy for us to to say that different hues are distinct.
We can see that blue, orange, red, etc are different and don’t easily mix them up.

The leftmost plot uses different hues
to separate the points belonging to different categories.
We can quickly identify that there is a tota of three distinct colors being used here
even without looking at the legend.

In the plot to the right
we used lightness within a single hue (blue) to label the different categories.
Here it is much harder to say how many different categories there are,
and even when we have the legend,
it is difficult to tell which points are which shade of blue.

---

## It is often better to use established color schemes instead of making your own

<center><img src=/module5/color-schemes.png></img></center>

Notes:
There are many different hues we could use to represent our colors
and some might not go as well together as others,
so how do we decide which ones to use?

Fortunately,
we don’t have to design our own combination of colors to use,
but can pick from combinations designed by experts to be easy to tell apart
and in most cases also suitable for people with color vision deficiencies.

These color combinations are referred to as color schemes in Altair,
but you might also hear them being called colormaps or color palettes.

In this slide, you can see some of the color schemes for categorical values
that are built into Altair.

The default one is “tableau10”
and it was named this way because it was originally designed by the company Tableau,
but is now one of the most common categorical color schemes used in data visualization.
[All Altair color schemes can be viewed here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/).

---

## Specifying color schemes in Altair

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=70, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Origin', title=None, scale=alt.Scale(scheme='set1')))
```

Notes:
You can change the color scheme of a plot by specifying its name as a string
to the `scheme` parameter inside `alt.Scale`.

To easier see the changes we are making to the colors,
we also increase the size of all points 
via the `size` parameter of the mark.

---

## Redundant coding can make charts easier to interpret

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=70, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Origin', title=None, scale=alt.Scale(scheme='set1')),
    shape='Origin')
```

Notes:
Although many of the color schemes in Altair 
are designed according to the guidelines for effective color uses,
they can sometimes be difficult to interpret 
for people with color vision deficiences.

Esppecially color schemes that mix red and green
as the one in the previous slide.

In addition to using a more suitable color scheme (such as the default),
we could also change the shape of the points for each category.

Although this is technically redundant
since the color is already used for the categorical groups,
it can make your visualization more effective.

For line plots we could achieve a similar effect via the `strokeDash` encoding
instead of `shape`,
which together with direct labeling from the previous slide deck
can facilitate interpretation of these plots.

---

## Specifying custom colors

```{python}
colors = ['coral', '#4682b4', 'rebeccapurple']
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=70, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Origin', title=None, scale=alt.Scale(range=colors)))
```

Notes:
Most of the time it is a good idea to stick to the predefined color scheme
because of the advantages mentioned in the previous slide.

However,
sometimes the categories we are representing might have a color already associated with them,
such as political parties or sports team.

In these cases,
it is often better to design a custom color scheme
using the colors naturally associated with each category.

In Altair we can create a custom color scheme by passing a list of colors 
to the `range` parameter of `alt.Scale`.

You can specify colors either by their HTML/CSS name (such as 'coral')
or their hex code (such as '#4682b4').
[All HTML/CSS color names can be found in the image in this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37232760/2166823).

Hex codes are defines over the range `#000000` for black ("zero color")
to `#ffffff` for white ("full color")
and [are easiest chosen via color pickers such as this one](https://colorpicker.me/).

---

## Don't use more than 5-8 distinct hues for categories

<center><img src=/module5/hue-guidelines.png></img></center>

Notes:
Although many of the categorical color schemes contain ten or more hues,
if is often not a good idea to use all that many.

The guidelines on what is too many hues differ between different sources
and also depends on your use case.
A good rule of thumb is that when you get to around five different hues,
you should really consider if this is the best way to represent your data
or if you could split it up into multiple visualizations instead.

If the data is neatly organized in well-separated clusters,
it is possible that you could visualize more than five colors
(maybe even ten) effectively,
but in data where the datapoints are more mixed,
you will rarely, if ever, be able to go this high.

---

## Too many hues are impossible to distinguish


alt.Chart(cars).mark_point(size=70, filled=True).encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color=alt.Color('Name', title=None))


Notes:
This is an example of what happens when too many categorical hues are used.
In this plot,
we can not separate the colors
even if we spent a considerable amount of effort studying the chart.

As we saw on the last slide,
categorical color schemes have a limited amount of hues
so in addition of it being hard to differentiate this many hues in general,
it become practically impossible in cases
where there are more categories than coor hues,
since the color scheme starts repeating as in the chart.

A better approach here would have been to label specific points of interest directly
and keeping the rest as either a single color or using a categorical variable with fewer values, e.g. by grouping the cars into brands rather than their full model name.

Since Altair allows for interactive elements,
we could also have used the tooltip here as we saw in a previous module.

---

## Redundant coding of bar charts can be disorienting

```{python}
cars['Brand'] = cars['Name'].str.split().str[0]  # Extract brand from name column
chart = alt.Chart(cars, width=200, height=450).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.Y('Brand', title=None, sort='x'),
    alt.X('mean(Horsepower)'))
alt.hconcat(chart, chart.encode(alt.Color('Brand', legend=None, scale=alt.Scale(scheme='tableau20'))))
```

Notes:
A few slides ago we saw how encoding the same variable as both shape and color
could make our figures more effective.

Quite frequently,
you might come across bar charts where the author of the visualization
has added a distinct color for each bar.

This can work when there are relatively few bars,
but it usually does not add anything
and can become directly disorienting when there are many bars
as in this slide.

It is usually preferable to color all the bars in the same color
(or after another categorical variable, such as "Origin" in this data),
and let the axis labels alone identify which category the bar belongs too.

One exception to this is if each axis label
is broken down into subcategories
where each location has multiple bars based on another categorical variable,
then color can help.

---

## Use consistent coloring between subplots even when it is redundant

```{python}
chart = alt.Chart(cars).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('Origin', title=None),
    alt.Y('mean(Horsepower)'),
    alt.Color('Origin'))
alt.hconcat(chart, chart.mark_line().encode(x='Year', strokeDash='Origin'))
```

Notes:

When creating a figure that contains several subplots,
it is important to be consistent in the coloring between these
even if the coloring is redundant in one of the subplots.

Here we have colored the bars to match the lines
although we could tell the categories only from reading the axis labels.

It is important to not use different colors for the same categories between subplots.
For example,
if we made an additional subplot which only contained Japan and USA,
then we should make sure that these are still colored in orange and red.
Since the default Altair color scheme will always start with blue,
we would need to manually specify the colors in this case.
