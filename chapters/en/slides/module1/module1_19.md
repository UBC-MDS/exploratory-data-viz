Notes:
By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:
1. Describe supervised learning and identify what kind of tasks it is suitable for.
2. Explain common machine learning concepts such as classification and regression, training and testing, overfitting, parameters and hyperparameters.
3. Identify when and why to apply data pre-processing techniques such as scaling and one hot encoding.
4. Describe at a high level how common machine learning algorithms work, including decision trees, kNN, naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests.
5. Use Python and the scikit-learn package to develop a machine learning model using the above algorithms.
