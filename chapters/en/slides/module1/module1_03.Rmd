# How Can We Visualize Data?

Notes:
There are many different data visualization strategies
so which one should we choose when visualizing our data?

---

## There are two types of visualization approaches

When learning about data visualization,
it is helpful to distinguish between the following two approaches to visualization:

1. Imperative
2. Declarative 

Notes: 

There are a plethora of visualization packages in Python.

This rich selection can be beneficial
but it is also confusing,
especially when starting out and trying to decide which package to choose.

When learning about data visualization,
it is helpful to distinguish between plotting packages that follow either an
*imperative* or a *declarative* visualization philosophy.


---

## Imperative (low level) plotting focuses on plot mechanics

- Focus on plot construction details.
    - Often includes loops, low-level drawing commands, etc.
- Specify *how* something should be done
    - "Draw a red point for every observation that has value X in column A,
      a blue point for every observation that has value Y in column A, etc."
- Minute control over plotting details, but laborious for complex visualization.

Notes:

**Imperative** (or **low level**) plotting packages
focus on plot construction details
such as *how* to implement the visualization
in terms of for-loops, low-level drawing commands, etc.

This approach gives us minute control over what is plotted,
but it becomes quite laborious when we need to plot larger dataframes,
or create more complex visualizations.

---

## The data we will be plotting

<center><table style="width:40%;">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">Country</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Area</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Population</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Russia</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">17098246</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">144386830</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Canada</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">9984670</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">38008005</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>China</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">9596961</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1400050000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></center>


Notes:

In the example in the next slide,
we will plot the area and the population
for the three largest countries in the world
to see how they compare.
This is the table we are plotting.

---

## Example of imperative plotting

```python
# Pseudocode
colors = ['blue', 'red', 'yellow']
plot = create_plot()
for row_number, row_data in enumerate(dataframe):
    plot.add_point(x=row_data['Area'], y=row_data['Population'], color=colors[row_number])
```

```{python echo=FALSE}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
from io import StringIO


data='''
Country|Area|Population
Russia|17098246|144386830
Canada|9984670|38008005
China|9596961|1400050000
'''

df = pd.read_table(StringIO(data), sep='|')

(alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=200).encode(
    alt.X('Area'),
    alt.Y('Population'),
    alt.Color('Country', legend=None, scale=alt.Scale(range=['steelblue', 'coral', '#FFDB58'])))
 .configure_axis(grid=False)
 .configure_view(stroke=None)
 .save('../../../../static/module1/pseudocode-plot.svg'))
```

<img src="/module1/pseudocode-plot.svg" alt="" width="52%"></img>

Notes:


For this example,
we will use Python-inspired pseudocode,
which is code that is made up
and designed so that it is less complex and easier to read
than real programming languages.

This helps us focus on understanding the concepts of plotting
instead of getting hung up on the code syntax details of a particular package.

You can see that an imperative approach to plotting this data
would be to first create the plot
and then loop through the dataframe
to add a point for each country one by one.

To colour the points,
we need to manually create a sequence of colours
that we can access inside the loop.

The visualization on this page is an example of what a plot could look like
when run with real code similar to our pseudocode.

You can see that one of the countries is bigger than the others,
and one of the countries has a much larger population,
but without seeing the code,
it is not possible to know which colour represents which country.

We could add a legend by creating it explicitly 
and adding one coloured dot per iteration in the loop.

---

## Declarative (high level) plotting focuses on the data

- Focus on data and relationships.
    - Often includes linking columns to visual channels.
- Specify *what* should be done
    - "Assign colors based on the values in column A"
- Smart defaults give us what we want without complete control over minor plotting details.

Notes:

**Declarative** (or **high level**) plotting packages
declare links between dataframe columns and visual channels,
such as the x-axis, y-axis, colour, *etc*.

This means that you can provide a high-level specification
of *what* you want the visualization to include,
and the plot details are handled automatically.

In summary, <br>
declarative visualization tools let you think about **data and relationships**,
while imperative visualization tools focus on **plot construction details**.

---

## Example of declarative plotting

```python
# Pseudocode
point_plot(data=dataframe, x='Area', y='Population', color='Country')
```

```{python echo=FALSE}
(alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=200).encode(
    alt.X('Area'),
    alt.Y('Population'),
    alt.Color('Country', scale=alt.Scale(range=['steelblue', 'coral', '#FFDB58'])))
 .configure_axis(grid=False)
 .configure_view(stroke=None)
 .save('../../../../static/module1/pseudocode-plot-with-legend.svg'))
```

<img src="/module1/pseudocode-plot-with-legend.svg" alt="" width="65%"></img>

Notes:
The visualization on this page is an example of what a plot could look like
when run with real code similar to our pseudocode.

You will notice that this time the plot also includes a legend
without us having to create it explicitly,
which is a common convenience in declarative plotting packages.

---

## A high-level grammar of graphics helps us compose plots effectively

- Simple grammatical components combine to create visualizations.
- Visualization grammars often consist of three main components:
    1. Create a chart linked to a dataframe.
    2. Add graphical elements (such as points, lines, etc).
    3. Encode dataframe columns as visual channels (such as x, etc).

```python
# Pseudocode
chart(dataframe).add_points().encode_columns(x='Area', y='Population', color='Country')`.
```

Notes:
The declarative plotting concept can be implemented in different ways.

In the previous slide, we had a dedicated function for creating the pointplot,
and there would be a separate function for creating a lineplot, barplot, etc.

With this approach,
it is often not easy to combine plots together,
unless there is a specific function for that purpose
and the three bullets points on this slide
are all executed by this single function.

Another way to use declarative plotting is via a visualization grammar.

Generally,
a grammar governs how individual parts come together to compose
more complex constructs.

For example,
a linguistic grammar decides how words and phrases can be combined into coherent sentences.
A data visualization grammar
determines how to combine individual parts of the plotting syntax
to create complete visualization.

In the example on this slide,
you can see that the three bullet points are now broken down into one main
function to create the chart linked to the data,
and then we build upon this by adding the graphical elements (`add_points()`)
and the encoding of the columns to properties of this chart (`encode_columns()`).

By combining these three grammatical components in different ways,
we can build a wide range of visualizations,
without memorizing a unique function for each plot type.

Thanks to this grammatical visualization approach,
we also only require minimal changes to our code
to change the type of plot.

## The Python plotting landscape

<br>
<br>
<br>

<img src="/module1/py-plotting-landscape.png" alt="The Python plotting landscape" width="100%"></img>

Notes:
Now that we know the basic concepts of how data can be visualized,
let's select a Python package and get coding!

In this image, you can see the most commonly used Python plotting packages.

There are many more,
but these are the ones you are the most likely to hear about,
so it is good to know that they exist.

The text to the left in the image is a legend
to explain the colours used for the different Python packages
(blue for high level, declarative packages
and orange for low-level, imperative packages).

As you can see there are several high and low-level language,
so how do we chose?

In this course we will use <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/" target="_blank">Altair</a>,
because it is a powerful declarative visualization tool
with a clear and consistent grammar
that also allows us to add interactive components to our plots,
such as tooltips and selections.

We have also included some of the most common visualization packages for the web
which are built-in Javascript and coloured in white.

The reason we mention these is that 
the Altair library is a little bit of Python code
connected to an already existing powerful JavaScript package called VegaLite,
which in turns builds on D3,
the most dominant visualization package on the web today.

By leveraging these well-established JavaScript visualization packages
Altair can create plots that work natively on the web
and includes interactive features without reinventing the wheel.

Since Altair and VegaLite are relatively new visualization libraries,
they don't yet support every single plot type out there,
but they more than make up for it with their ease of use
and support for powerful interactive visualizations,
as we will see later.

---

## Sample data can be found in Altair's companion package vega_datasets

```{python}
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()
cars
```

Notes:
Before we start visualizing data,
we need to select a dataset and often also a question we want to answer.

Altair works with dataframes in the <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html" target="_blank">"tidy"</a> format (which we talked about in the <a href="https://prog-learn.mds.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">Programming in Python for Data Science course</a>),
which means that they should consist of 
rows with one **observation** each
and a set of named data **columns**
with one feature each
(you might also have heard these called **fields** or **variables**,
but we will stick to **columns** for clarity).

In this course,
we will often use data from the  <a href="https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets" target="_blank">vega-datasets</a> package,
which has many plot-friendly practice datasets available as Pandas dataframes
and can be loaded as demonstrated in this slide.
We can use these datasets by importing the `data` module
from the `vega_datasets` packages
as in this slide.
Here,
our data contains the name of different cars
and some attributes relating to each car.
There are many interesting questions we could ask from this data set!
For our first plot,
let's explore the relationship between how heavy a car is
(the `Weight_in_lbs` column)
and how good gas mileage it has
(the`Miles_per_gallon` column).

Before starting to code the visualization,
take a few seconds and think about
what you would expect the relationship between these two columns to look like when you plot it.

---

## Adding graphical elements via marks

```{python}
import altair as alt

alt.Chart(cars).mark_point()
```

Notes:
Here we assigned a shorter name (`alt`)
to the Altair library when importing it
to save us some typing later.
The Altair syntax is similar to the grammar of graphics pseudocode
we saw a few slides ago.
The fundamental object in Altair is the `Chart`,
which takes a data frame as a single argument,
e.g. `alt.Chart(cars)`.

After the chart object has been created,
we can specify how the graphical element should look
that we use to visualize the data.
This is called a graphical *mark* in Altair,
and in this slide, we have used `mark_point()` to show the data as points.

Since we have not specified which columns should be used for the x and y axes,
we appear to only see one point in this plot
since all the data is plotted on top of each other in the same location.

To the right of the chart, there is a button with three dots on it.
don't worry about it right now,
we will explain what this is for at the end of the chapter.

---

## Encoding columns as visual channels

### Mapping a dataframe column to the x-scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs')
```

Notes:
To visually separate the points,
we can encode columns in the dataframe
as visual channels,
such as the axes or colours of the plot.

Here,
we *encode* the column `Miles_per_Gallon` as the x-axis.
For Pandas data frames,
Altair automatically determines an appropriate data type for the mapped column,
which in this case is quantitative (or numerical)
and shows the numbers under the axis.

You can see that there are several short black lines spread out evenly on the x-axis.
These are called axis ticks
and help us see where the values of this dataframe column lie along the axis.

The faint gray lines are called grid lines
and extend the locations of the axis ticks
so that it is easy to compare their position to the points.

This is particularly useful when the points might be further away
from the axis ticks,
such as in the next slide.

---

## Mapping a dataframe column to the y-scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon')
```

Notes:
By spreading out the data along both the x and y-axis,
we can answer our initial question about the relationship between car weight and gas mileage.
as it appears that the heavier cars are the ones that have the poorest mileage.

Although we might have expected this to be the case,
visualizing all the data points also provides
information on the nature of the relationship between weight and mileage.

It appears that the x-y points don't simply follow a straight line,
but rather a curved line that where the mileage drop quickly
when moving away from the lightest cars,
but then decreases more slowly throughout the remainder of the data.

This rich, easily interpretable display of information
is one of the main advantages of visualizing data
and later in the course, we will talk more about the different type of relationships,
such as linear, exponential, etc.

---

## Mapping a numerical dataframe column to the colour scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Horsepower')
```

Notes:

Is there a relationship between horsepower and car weight, or fuel-efficiency?

To enrich this display of information further,
we can colour the points according to a column in the dataframe.
When we encode a column as the colour channel
Altair will automatically figure out an appropriate colour scale to use,
depending on whether the data is numerical, categorical, etc.
Here we have indicated that we want to colour the points according to the car's horsepower,
which indicated how powerful its engine is.

We can see that the heavier cars have more powerful engines,
than the lighter ones,
but when using colour for a numerical comparison like this,
makes it is harder to tell whether the relationship follows a straight line 
or is of another nature,
so this encoding is mostly useful as an approximate indication of the horsepower.

We can also observe a relationship between the horsepower of a vehicle and the fuel efficiency. It appears that cars with greater horsepower (the points with a darker shade of blue) are less efficient with their fuel since miles per Gallon is much lower. 

In the next module, we will learn more in detail about 
which encodings are most suitable for different comparisons.

---

## Mapping a categorical dataframe column to the colour scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin')
```

Notes:
In the previous slide,
a continuous, gradually increasing colour scale was used
to visualize the gradual increase in the numerical column `Horsepower`.
In this slide,
we instead chose to colour the points per the categorical column `Origin`
(where the car was made).

As you can see,
Altair detects that this column contains categorical data
(with the help of pandas)
and picks a different colour scale to facilitate distinction between the categories.
As in the previous slide,

Altair automatically adds a helpful legend,
and we can see that the heavier, more powerful cars are primarily manufactured in the US,
while the lighter more fuel-efficient ones are manufactured in Europe and Japan
(remember that this is true for this particular dataset,
and not necessarily all cars).

---

## Mapping a dataframe column to the shape scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    shape='Origin')
```

Notes:
Although Altair's colour scales are designed to be effective and easy to interpret,
we can make the categories in our plot even more distinct
by encoding the same categorical column as both colour and shape.

This also makes visualizations much easier to interpret and understand
for anyone with visual colour deficiency
(about 10% of the population).
We will talk more in-depth about colour theory in a later module.

---

## Mapping a dataframe column to the size scale


```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    shape='Origin',
    size='Horsepower')
```

Notes:
Sometimes a visualization tries to do too much.
In this example,
we have added the size channel
to indicate the engine power.

Although Altair elegantly handles the dual legends,
it is difficult for us to discern useful information from this plot.
If you go back to the plot where we encoded weight in the colour channel,
you can see that the plot is much clearer.

Later we will learn more about how to efficiently load a visualization
with an appropriate amount of information,
and what the research indicates
regarding which visual channels are the most efficient
for communicating information visually.

---

## The action button can be used to save the plot

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    shape='Origin',
    size='Horsepower')
```

Notes:
This is the same visualization as from the last slide,
and we will just use it as an example.

The button to the right of the chart with three dots on it
is called the "action button".
and clicking it will bring up a menu.

The first two items in 's menu can be used to save the chart,
either in an image-based PNG-format or a text-based SVG-format.

We will also be learning about programmatic ways to save our charts later in the course.

The last three menu items relate to the library VegaLite,
which is what we mentioned Altair is built upon,
but we will not be using these in this course.

---

# Let's apply what we learned!
