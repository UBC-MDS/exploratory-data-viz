# What is Data Visualization?

Notes:
At its core,
data visualization is about representing numbers with graphical elements,
such as position, area, color, etc.
Picking the most appropriate component for you data can be tricky,
but fortunately there is research
on which are the most appropriate for different situations
as we will see later.

---

## Why bother visualizing data instead of showing raw numbers?

### Can you spot the differences between these four sets of numbers?

```{python echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# This is the code that generates the table below,
# but you need to run it outside of here so that you can copy and paste the raw HTML and not have it wrapped in an output code block
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

anscombe = data.anscombe()#.query('Series != "IV"')
anscombe['Set'] = anscombe['Series'].map({'I': 'A', 'II': 'B', 'III': 'C', 'IV': 'D'})
anscombe = anscombe.drop(columns='Series')
anscombe.loc[anscombe['Y'] == anscombe['Y'].max(), 'Y'] = 8.5

for set_name, df in anscombe.groupby('Set'):
    df = df.drop(columns='Set')
    df.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([(set_name, 'X'), (set_name, 'Y')])
    print(
        df
        .to_html(index=False)
        .replace('class="dataframe"', 'style="width:70px; float:left; margin-right:40px"')
        .replace('<thead>',  '<thead style="text-align: center">'))
```

Notes:
Think about it,
numbers have only been around for about 5,000 years.
Visual systems on the other hand,
have undergone refinement for over 500,000,000 years
by training with a lethal, evolutionary cost function.
While we need to train ourselves to recognize structure in numerical data,
we have evolved to instinctively recognize visual patterns
and to accurately judge properties such as colors and distances between objects.
Drawing upon this complex build-in apparatus,
we can arrive at conclusion much faster by glancing at visual representations of data
rather than numerical representations.

For example, have a look at the
four sets of numbers in the table on the slide.
This is a slightly modified version of the original,
[which was put together by statistician Francis Anscombe in the
70s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet)
Can you see how the sets are different from each other
by just glancing at the table?

## Although summary statistics are often useful, they don't tell the whole story

### Set C appears to be slightly different, but are the other sets actually identical?


```{python echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
for set_name, df in anscombe.groupby('Set'):
    df = df.drop(columns='Set')
    df.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([(set_name, 'X'), (set_name, 'Y')])
    print(
        df
        .agg(['mean', 'std']).round(2).reset_index().rename(columns={'index': ''})
        .to_html(index=False)
        .replace('class="dataframe"', 'style="width:70px; float:left; margin-right:40px"')
        .replace('<thead>',  '<thead style="text-align: center">'))
```

Notes:
Summaries,
such as the mean and standard deviation,
are helpful statistical tools
that are often useful for detecting difference between datasets.
However,
since they collapse the data into just a few numbers,
statistical summaries can't tell the whole story about the data
and there can be important differences between datasets
that summaries fail to reveal.

---

## Plotting the data immediately reveals the differences to the human eye

### There are clear patterns in these datasets that we could not detect from looking at the numbers

```{python include=FALSE}
def bigger_font():
    return {
        'config': {
            'view': {'continuousWidth': 400, 'continuousHeight': 300},
            'legend': {'symbolSize': 14, 'titleFontSize': 14, 'labelFontSize': 14},
            'axis': {'titleFontSize': 14, 'labelFontSize': 12},
            'header': {'titleFontSize': 16, 'labelFontSize': 14},
            'encoding': {'x': {'scale': {'zero': False}}}}}
alt.themes.register('bigger_font', bigger_font)
alt.themes.enable('bigger_font')

(alt.Chart(anscombe).mark_circle(size=80, opacity=1).encode(
    x='X',
    y='Y')
 .properties(width=300, height=200)
 .facet('Set', columns=2)
 .configure_axis(grid=True)
 .configure_header(title=None)
 .save(path + 'modified-anscombes.svg'))
```

<img src="/module1/modified-anscombes.svg" alt="" width="65%"></img>

Notes:
Humans are not good at detecting patterns in raw numbers,
and we don't have good intuition about how different distributions of data
can contribute to identical statistical summaries.
But guess what we excel at?
Detecting visual patterns!
It is immediately clear to us how these sets of numbers differ
once they are shown as graphical elements
instead of textual objects.
This is one of the main reasons why data visualization
is such a powerful tool for data exploration and communication.

## More examples of plotting versus statistical summaries

![](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/downloads/DataSaurus%20Dozen.gif)

Matejka and Fitzmaurice, 2017

Notes:
A more recent and dynamic illustration of
how graphical representations are much easier for us to interpret
compared to statistical summaries,
is the Datasaurus GIF ([from Autodesk's research team](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)) in this slide.
It displays several different datasets,
all with the same mean, standard deviation and correlation between X and Y,
but looking at the data graphically shows us how different these datasets actually are.
