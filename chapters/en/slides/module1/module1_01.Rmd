# What is Data Visualization?

Notes:
At its core,
data visualization is about representing numbers with graphical components.
These include many components, such as position, area, color, etc.
Picking the most appropriate component for you data can be tricky,
but fortunately there is research on which are the most appropriate for different situations
as we will see later.

## Why bother visualizing data instead of showing raw numbers?

### Can you spot the differences between these four sets of numbers?

Notes:
Think about it, numbers have been around for about 5,000 years.
Visual systems, on the other hand, have undergone refinement for over
500,000,000 years by training with a lethal, evolutionary cost function.
While we need to train ourselves to recognize structure in numerical
data, we have evolved to instinctively recognize visual patterns and to
accurately judge properties such as colors and distances between
objects. Drawing upon this complex build-in apparatus, we can arrive at
conclusion much faster by glancing at visual representations of data
rather than numerical representations.

For example, have a look at the
four sets of numbers in the table below, [put together by statistician
Francis Anscombe in the
70s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) Can you see
how the sets are different from each other by just glancing at the
table?

## Summary statistics don't necessarily help

### All four sets of numbers are nearly identical in the following statistical properties

<table style="width:80%;">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Property
</th>
<th>Value
</th>
<th>Accuracy
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/wiki/Mean" title="Mean">Mean</a> of <i>x</i>
</td>
<td>9
</td>
<td>exact
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sample <a href="/wiki/Variance" title="Variance">variance</a> of <i>x</i></td>
<td>11
</td>
<td>exact
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Mean of <i>y</i>
</td>
<td>7.50
</td>
<td>to 2 decimal places
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Sample variance of <i>y</i></td>
<td>4.125
</td>
<td>Â±0.003
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/wiki/Correlation" class="mw-redirect" title="Correlation">Correlation</a> between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
</td>
<td>0.816
</td>
<td>to 3 decimal places
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/wiki/Linear_regression" title="Linear regression">Linear regression</a> line
</td>
<td><i>y</i>&#160;=&#160;3.00&#160;+&#160;0.500<i>x</i>
</td>
<td>to 2 and 3 decimal places, respectively
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination" title="Coefficient of determination">Coefficient of determination</a> of the linear regression</td>
<td>0.67
</td>
<td>to 2 decimal places
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Notes:
What about if I showed you the commonly used numerical summaries of the data?
Tough luck,
all the summary statistics in the table below are **the same** for each of these four set.

## Plotting the data immediately reveals the differences to the human eye

<img src="/module1/anscombes-quartet.png" alt="A caption" width="80%"></img>

Notes:
Humans are not good at detecting patterns in raw numbers,
and we don't have good intuition about which combination of numbers can contribute to the same statistical summaries.
But guess what we excel at? Detecting visual patterns!
It is immediately clear to us how these sets of numbers differ
once they are shown as graphical objects
instead of textual objects.
And this is one of the main reasons why data visualization
is such a powerful tool for data exploration and communication.

## More examples of plotting versus statistical summaries

![](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/downloads/DataSaurus%20Dozen.gif)

Notes:
For a dynamic, more recent, and avian illustration of how graphical representations are much easier for us to interpret compared to statistical summaries,
check out the [Datasaurus GIF](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs) below.
It displays several different datasets,
all with the same mean, standard deviation and correlation between X and Y,
but looking at the data graphically shows us how different datasets actually are.
