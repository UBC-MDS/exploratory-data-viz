# How Can We Visualize Data?

Notes:
There is a plethora of visualization packages in Python.
This rich selection can be beneficial
but it is also confusing,
especially when starting out and trying to decide which package to choose.
When learning about data visualization,
it is helpful to distinguish between *imperative* and *declarative* plotting packages.

---

## Imperative (low level) plotting focuses on plot mechanics

- Focus on plot construction details.
    - Often includes loops, low-level drawing commands, etc.
- Specify *how* something should be done
    - "Draw a red point for every observation that has value X in column A,
      a blue point for every observation that has value Y in column A, etc."
- Minute control over plotting details, but laborious for complex visualization.

Notes:
*Imperative* (or *low level*) plotting packages
focus on plot construction details
such as *how* to implement the visualization
in terms of for-loops, low-level drawing commands, etc.
This approach gives us minute control over what is plotted,
but it becomes quite laborious when we need to plot larger dataframes,
or create more complex visualizations.

---

## Example of imperative plotting

```python
# Pseudocode
colors = ['blue', 'red', 'yellow']
plot = create_plot()
for row_number, row_data in enumerate(dataframe):
    plot.add_point(x=row_data['Area'], y=row_data['Population'], color=colors[row_number])
```

```{python echo=F}
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
from io import StringIO


data='''
Country|Area|Population
Russia|17098246|144386830
Canada|9984670|38008005
China|9596961|1400050000
'''

df = pd.read_table(StringIO(data), sep='|')

(alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=200).encode(
    alt.X('Area'),
    alt.Y('Population'),
    alt.Color('Country', legend=None, scale=alt.Scale(range=['steelblue', 'coral', '#FFDB58'])))
 .configure_axis(grid=False)
 .configure_view(stroke=None)
 .save('../../../../static/module1/pseudocode-plot.svg'))
```

<img src="/module1/pseudocode-plot.svg" alt="" width="52%"></img>

Notes:
In the example in this slide,
we will plot the area and the population
for the three largest countries in the world
to see how they compare.
This is the table we are plotting:

<table style="width:40%;">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">Country</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Area</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Population</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Russia</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">17098246</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">144386830</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Canada</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">9984670</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">38008005</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>China</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">9596961</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">1400050000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For this example,
we will use Python-inspired pseudocode,
which is code that is made up
and designed so that it is less complex and easier to read
than real programming languages.
This helps us focus on understanding the concepts of plotting
instead of getting hung up on the code syntax details of a particular package.

You can see that an imperative approach to plotting this data
would be to first create the plot
and then loop through the dataframe
to add a point for each country one by one.
To color the points,
we need to manually create a sequence of colors
that we can access inside the loop.

The visualization on this page is an example of what a plot could look like
when run with real code similar to our pseudocode.
You can see that one of the countries is bigger than the others,
and one of the countries has a much larger population,
but without seeing the code,
it is not possible to know which color represent which country.
We could add a legend by creating it explicitly 
and adding one colored dot per iteration in the loop.

---

## Declarative (high level) plotting focuses on the data

- Focus on data and relationships.
    - Often includes linking columns to visual channels.
- Specify *what* should be done
    - "Assign colors based on the values in column A"
- Smart defaults gives us what we want without complete control over minor plotting details.

Notes:
*Declarative* (or *high level*) plotting packages
declaring links between dataframe columns and visual channels,
such as the x-axis, y-axis, color, *etc*.
This means that you can provide a high-level specification
of *what* you want the visualization to include,
and the plot details are handled automatically.

In summary,
declarative visualization tools let you think about **data and relationships**,
while imperative visualization tools focus on **plot construction details**.

---

## Example of declarative plotting

```python
# Pseudocode
point_plot(data=dataframe, x='Area', y='Population', color='Country')
```

```{python echo=F}
(alt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=200).encode(
    alt.X('Area'),
    alt.Y('Population'),
    alt.Color('Country', scale=alt.Scale(range=['steelblue', 'coral', '#FFDB58'])))
 .configure_axis(grid=False)
 .configure_view(stroke=None)
 .save('../../../../static/module1/pseudocode-plot-with-legend.svg'))
```

<img src="/module1/pseudocode-plot-with-legend.svg" alt="" width="65%"></img>

Notes:
The visualization on this page is an example of what a plot could look like
when run with real code similar to our pseudocode.
You will notice that this time the plot also includes a legend
without us having to create it explicitly,
which is a common convenience in declarative plotting packages.

---

## A high level grammar of graphics helps us compose plots effectively

- Simple grammatical components combine to create visualizations.
- Visualization grammars often consist of three main components:
    1. Create a chart linked to a dataframe.
    2. Add graphical elements (such as points, lines, etc).
    3. Encode dataframe columns as visual channels (such as x, etc).

```python
# Pseudocode
chart(dataframe).add_points().encode_columns(x='Area', y='Population', color='Country')`.
```

Notes:
The declarative plotting concept can be implemented in different ways.
In the previous slide we had a dedicated function for creating the pointplot,
and there would be a separate function for creating a lineplot, barplot, etc.
With this approach,
it is often not easy to combine plots together,
unless there is a specific function for that purpose
and the three bullets points on this slide
are all executed by this single function.

Another way to use declarative plotting is via a visualization grammar.
Generally,
a grammar governs how individual parts come together to compose
more complex constructs.
For example,
a linguistic grammar decides how words and phrases can be combined into coherent sentences.
A data visualization grammar
determines how to combine individual parts of the plotting syntax
to create complete visualization.

In the example on this slide,
you can see that the three bullet points are now broken down into one main
function to create the chart linked to the data,
and then we build upon this by adding the graphical elements (`add_points()`)
and the encoding of the columns to properties of this chart (`encode_columns()`).

By combining these three grammatical components in different ways,
we can build a wide range of visualizations,
without memorizing a unique function for each plot type.
Thanks to this grammatical visualization approach,
we also only require minimal changes to our code
to change the type of plot.

## The Python plotting landscape

<img src="/module1/py-plotting-landscape.png" alt="The Python plotting landscape" width="100%"></img>

Notes:
Now that we know the basic concepts of how data can be visualized,
let's select a Python package and get coding!
In this image you can see the most commonly used Python plotting packages.
There are many more,
but these are the ones you are the most likely to hear about,
so it is good to know that they exist.
As you can see there are several high and low level language,
so how do we chose?

In this course we have chosen to use [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/),
because it is a powerful declarative visualization tool
with a clear and consistent grammar
that also allows us to add interactive components to our plots,
such as tooltips and selections.

---

## Sample data can be found in Altair's companion package vega_datasets

```{python}
from vega_datasets import data


cars = data.cars()
cars
```

Notes:
Before we start visualizing data,
we need to select a dataset and often also a question we want to answer.
Altair works with dataframes in the ["tidy"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) format,
which means that they should consist of 
rows with one *observation* each
and a set of named data *columns*
with one feature each
(you might also have heard these called *fields* or *variables*,
but we will stick to *columns* for clarity).

In this course,
we will often use data from the [vega-datasets](https://github.com/vega/vega-datasets) package,
which has many plot-friendly practice datasets available as Pandas dataframes,
and can be loaded as demonstrated in this slide.
Here,
our data contains the name of different cars
and some attributes relating to each car.
There are many interesting questions we could ask from this data set!
For our first plot,
let's explore the relationship between how heavy car is
(the *Weight_in_lbs* column)
and how good gas mileage it has
(the *Miles_per_gallon* column).

Before starting to code the visualization,
take a few seconds and think about
what you would expect the relationship between these two columns to look like when you plot it.

---

## Adding graphical elements via marks

```{python}
import altair as alt


alt.Chart(cars).mark_point()
```

Notes:
The Altair syntax is similar to the grammar of graphics pseudocode
we saw a few slides ago.
The fundamental object in Altair is the `Chart`,
which takes a data frame as a single argument,
e.g. `alt.Chart(cars)`.

After the chart object has been created,
we can specify how the graphical element should look
that we use to visualize the data.
This is called a graphical *mark* in Altair,
and in this slide we have used `mark_point()` to show the data as points.

Since we have not specified which columns should be used for the x and y axes,
we appear to only see one point in this plot
since all the data is plotted on top of each other in the same location.

---

## Encoding columns as visual channels

### Mapping a dataframe column to the x-scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs')
```

Notes:
To visually separate the points,
we can encode columns in the dataframe
as visual channels,
such as the axes or colors of the plot.
Here,
we *encode* the column `Miles_per_Gallon` as the x-axis.
For Pandas data frames,
Altair automatically determines an appropriate data type for the mapped column,
which in this case is quantitative (or numerical)
and shows the numbers under the axis.

---

## Mapping a dataframe column to the y-scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon')
```

Notes:
By spreading out the data along the both the x and y-axis,
we can answer our initial question about the relationship between car weight and gas mileage.
as it appears that the heavier cars are the ones that have the poorest mileage.
Although we might have expected this to be the case,
visualizing all the data points also provides
information on the nature of the relationship between weight and mileage.
It appears that the xy points don't simply follow a straight line,
but rather a curved line that where the mileage drop quickly
when moving away from the lightest cars,
but then decrease more slowly throughout the remainder of the data.

This rich, easily interpretable display of information
is one of the main advantages from visualizing data
and later in the course we will talk more about different type of relationships,
such as linear, exponential, etc.

---

## Mapping a numerical dataframe column to the color scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Horsepower')
```

Notes:
To enrich this display of information further,
we can color the points according to a column in the dataframe.
When we encode a column as the color channel
Altair will automatically figure out an appropriate colorscale to use,
depending on whether the data is numerical, categorical, etc.
Here we have indicated that we want to color the points according to the car's horsepower,
which indicated how powerful its engine is.

We can see that the heavier cars have more powerful engines,
than the lighter ones,
but when using color for a numerical comparison like this,
makes it is harder to tell whether the relationship follows a straight line 
or is of another nature,
so this encoding is mostly useful as an approximate indication of the horsepower.
In the net module we will learn more in detail about 
which encodings are most suitable for different comparisons.

---

## Mapping a categorical dataframe column to the color scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin')
```

Notes:
In the previous slide,
a continuous, gradually increasing colorscale was used
to visualize the gradual increase in the numerical column `Horsepower`.
In this slide,
we instead chose to color the points per the categorical column `Origin`
(where the car was made).
As you can see,
Altair detects that this column contains categorical data
(with the help of pandas)
and picks a different colorscale to facilitate distinction between the categories.
As in the previous slide,
Altair automatically adds a helpful legend,
and we can see that the heavier, more powerful cars are primary manufactured in the US,
while the lighter more fuel efficient ones are manufactured in Europe and Japan
(remember that this is true for this particular dataset,
and not necessarily all cars).

---

## Mapping a dataframe column to the shape scale

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    shape='Origin')
```

Notes:
Although Altair's colorscales are designed to be effective and easy to interpret,
we can make the categories in our plot even more distinct
by encoding the same categorical column as both color and shape.
This is also makes visualizations much easier to interpret understand
for anyone with visual color deficiency
(about 10% of the population).
We will talk more in depth about color theory in a later module.

---

## Mapping a dataframe column to the size scale


```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
    shape='Origin',
    size='Horsepower')
```

Notes:
Sometimes a visualization tries to do too much.
In this example,
we have added the size channel
to indicate the engine power.
Although Altair elegantly handles the dual legends,
it is difficult for us to discern useful information from this plot.
If you go back to the plot where we encoded weight in the color channel,
you can see that the plot is much clearer.
Later we will learn more about how to efficiently load a visualization
with an appropriate amount of information,
and what the research indicates
regarding which visual channels are the most efficient
for communicating information visually.
