# Creating area charts

Notes:
In this module
we will be learning how to create area charts 
and when they are a suitable alternative to use
instead of line charts.

Notes:
We will be visualizing global health data to answer the question:
How has the population for different regions around the world changed over time?

This is the same data we are working with in the assignments for the first two modules.

We will be looking at many different data sets in later labs,
but we're sticking to a familiar one for now
so that we can focus on laying down a solid understanding
of the visualization principles
with data we already know.

---

## Read in and glimpse at the data with pandas

```{python}
import pandas as pd

gm = pd.read_csv('data/world-data-gapminder.csv', parse_dates=['year'])
# TODO remove when we change to HTML or rewrite text as for why top ten
gm = gm[gm['country'].isin(gm[gm['year'] == '2018'].nlargest(10, ['population'])['country'])]
gm
```

Notes:
This dataset is made available via an URL
and we can download and read it into pandas
with `read_csv`.

Here we also tell pandas to read in the `year` column as a date,
rather than an integer,
which is the default behaviour.

Remember that Altair uses the pandas data types
to infer the data it is working with.
Integers would show up on the Altair chart axes as `1,990, 2,000, etc`
whereas dates are shown as `1990, 2000, etc`

---

## Using `info` to view dataframe columns

```{python}
gm.info()
```

Notes:
When reading in a new dataset,
it is always a good idea to have a look at a few rows
like we did in the previous slide
to get an idea of how the data looks.

Another helpful practice is to use the `.info()` method
to get an overview of the column types
and see if there are any `NaNs` (missing values).

---

## A line chart is a good choice for trends over time

```{python}
import altair as alt


alt.Chart(gm).mark_line().encode(
    x='year',
    y='population')
```

Notes:
Since the data reaches all the way back to the 1800s,
it would be really interesting to plot
how the world population have been growing up until today.
We could use a line plot for this
as we learned in the first module.

Why does the plot look so weird?

Because for every year in the dataset,
we have plotted the population for every single country
and connected them with a vertical line.

That's not what we want!

---

## The `sum` aggregate method will show us the trend of the entire world

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm).mark_line().encode(
    x='year',
    y='sum(population)')
```

Notes:
We want to see how the **world** population has been changing.

We can calculate this by summing up all the countries'
populations for each year via the `sum` aggregation method in Altair.

That looks much better!

Interestingly,
it seem like the world population have been growing in two distinct phases.

We will talk more about that in a few slides,
but first,
let's recreate this chart as an area chart.

---

## Area charts are also effective at visualizing trends over time

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm).mark_area().encode(
    x='year',
    y='sum(population)')
```

Notes:
Thanks to Altair's consistent visualization grammar,
the modification we need to make to the code are minor.
Replace `mark_line` with `mark_area` and we're done.

For showing a single trend over time,
the choice between a line and area chart comes down to aesthetics.
They are both effective choices for communicating

However,
when visualizing the trends over time for multiple groups,
lines and areas have different advantages,
as we will see next.

---

## Area charts are preferred when the total of the groups is the most important

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm).mark_area().encode(
    x='year',
    y='sum(population)',
    color='region')
```

Notes:
The y-axis range of this chart
is the same as the one on the previous slide,
so it is easy to see how the total world population has changed over time.

From the stacked coloured regions,
we also get a rough idea of how each region has grown,
but it is hard to compare exactly,
especially for regions that are not stacked next to each other.

For example,
we can't really tell if Europe, Africa, or the Americas
has the largest population in the most recent year.

---

## Line charts are preferred when the values of the individual groups are the most important

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm).mark_line().encode(
    x='year',
    y='sum(population)',
    color='region')
```

Notes:
Using a line chart
is the preferred choice when we want to view the exact values of each group
and don't care as much about the total of the groups added together.

For example,
here it is immediately clear that Africa has a bigger population 
than Europe and the America,
and we can see that the populations shifted around year 2000.

On the other hand,
it's quite cognitively demanding
to try to reconstruct the total world population
by adding all the lines up together,
especially over time!

---

## When will the world's population stop growing?

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm).mark_area().encode(
    x='year',
    y='sum(population)')
```

Notes:
Going back to the area chart with one group,
let's look closer at the growth curve of the world's population.

First,
there is a slow linear phase,
but soon after the end of the second world war,
it the growth starts increasing much more rapidly
(but still in a straight line).

Will the world population keep growing like this for much longer?

---

## The world population is predicted to stabilize around 11 billion

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm).mark_area().encode(
    x='year',
    y='mean(children_per_woman)')
```

Notes:
Fortunately,
the world population is predicted
to stabilize around 11 billion people at the end of the century.

Why?
Because as living conditions improve around the world,
child mortality is going down,
which means that the number of children per women is decreasing
towards a level than means that the current population will be sustained
rather than increase.

If you're interested in knowing more about the world population predictions,
you can use Gapminders online resources,
for example [this video on population growh](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-did-the-world-population-change/)
and [this one on why it will slow down](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/the-rapid-growth-of-the-world-population-when-will-it-slow-down/).
