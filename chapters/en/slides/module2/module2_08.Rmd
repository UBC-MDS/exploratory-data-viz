# Creating bar charts and histograms

Notes:
In this module
we will be learning how to create bars charts for counting observations,
and a special types of bar chars called histograms
for showing distributions of data.

---

## Subsetting the global development data

```{python}
import pandas as pd

gm = pd.read_csv('data/world-data-gapminder.csv', parse_dates=['year'])
gm2018 = gm[gm['year'] == '2018']
gm2018
```

Notes:
In this slide deck,
we will continue to work with the gapminder dataset.

To make it more suitable for this slide deck
let's subset it to include observations from the year 2018 only.

When filtering on a date in pandas,
we can either type out just the year portion
or the entire date string in the format shown in the slide.

---

## Creating a bar chart of the total population per continent

```{python}
import altair as alt

alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x='region',
    y=alt.Y('sum(population)', title='Population'))
```

Notes:
Bar charts are often avoided when showing summary statistics such as the mean
because they hide any variation,
something we will talk more about in later modules.

But they are fine for showing statistics
such as counts of observations, summations, or individual values
(e.g. the number of people in a country for a specific year).

Here we create a bar chart of a single value per country,
which represents the sum of all the countries' populations.

---

## Horizontal bar charts are made by switching the x and y encoding

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('sum(population)', title='Population'),
    y='region')
```

Notes:
If we switched x and y,
we would create a horizontal bar chart instead.

Although vertical bar charts are more commonly seen,
horizontal bar charts are preferred
when the labels on the categorical axis
become so long that they need to be rotated
to be readable in a vertical bar chart.

Since this is the case for our plot,
we will continue to use horizontal bar charts
in this slide deck.

---

## Visualizing counts of values with bar charts

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x='count()',
    y='region')
```

Notes:
To count values,
we can use the aggregation function `count()` in Altair.

We don't need to specify a column name for the y-axis,
since we are just counting values in each categorical group on the y-axis.

---

## Ordering bars makes them easier to interpret

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y='region')
```

Notes:
Unless the categorical axis has a natural order to it,
it is best to sort bar charts from high to low values.

This makes it easier to see any trends in the data,
and to compare bars of similar height more carefully.

To sort the bars,
we will use the helper functions `alt.X` and `alt.Y`,
instead of `x=` and `y=`.

These have the role of customizing things like order, groups, and scale for the axis.
When using just `y='column'`,
we're still calling `alt.Y()` under the hood,
we just save ourselves some typing.

In this slide,
we use `alt.Y`
on its own without any additional argument
to recreate the same plot as above
just to demonstrate how it works.

---

## Ordering bars makes them easier to interpret

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y=alt.Y('region', sort='x'))
```

Notes:
Sorting can now be done via the `sort` parameter in `alt.Y`.

In this example,
we're typing `sort='x'` to specify that we want to sort
according to the values on the y-axis.

When sorting by value,
it is often more visually appealing with the longest bar
the closet to the axis line,
as in this slide.

---

## The longest bar should be the closest to the axis line

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y=alt.Y('region', sort='-x'))
```

If we for some reason would want the reverse order,
we could use the minus sign before the axis reference.
This can be helpful in cases where you are making a vertical bar chart,
since it would then align the tallest bar next to the y-axis.

---

## Sorting in a custom order

```{python}
my_order = ['Africa', 'Europe', 'Oceania', 'Asia', 'Americas']
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y=alt.Y('region', sort=my_order))
```

Notes:
Sometimes there is a natural order to our data
that we want to use for the bars,
for example days of the week.

For situations like this,
we can pass a list or array
to the `sort` parameter.

We can either create this list manually as we did in this slide,
or use the pandas sort function if we wanted
for example reverse alphabetical order.

To learn more about good considerations
when plotting counts of categorical observations,
you can refer to [chapter 6 of Fundamental of Data Visualizations](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-amounts.html).

---

## Using bars to show counts of quantitative values

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('life_expectancy'),
    y='count()')
```

Notes:
So far we have been counting observations in categorical groups
(the continents).

Another common use of bar charts is to count how many observations
fall into numerical intervals
in an attempt to estimate the distribution, or shape, of the entire dataset.

This type of chart is so common that it has its own name: histogram.

The first step we need to perform in Altair,
is to divide the axis into intervals,
which is called binning.

If we would skip this binning step,
a bar would be plotted for each of the unique numerical values,
and our histogram would look very spiky as you can see in this slide.

This is because there are very few values that are exactly the same.

For example,
values like 67.2, 69.3, 69.5, etc,
would all get their own bar
instead of being in the same bar
representing the interval 65-70.

---

## In a histogram each bar represents a range of values

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('life_expectancy', bin=True),
    y='count()')
```

Notes:
To enable binning of the x-axis in Altair,
we can set `bin=True` inside `alt.X`.

This automatically calculates a suitable number of bins,
and counts up all the values within each group
before plotting a bar representing this count.

In contrast to bar charts,
it is rarely beneficial to make horizontal histograms
since the labels are numbers which don't need to be rotated to be readable.

---

## Changing the number of bins

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('life_expectancy', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),
    y='count()')
```

Notes:
Although the automatically calculated number of bins is often appropriate,
it tends to be on the low side.

While to many bins make the plot look spiky,
having too few bins can hide the true shape of the data distribution.

We can change the number of bins by passing `alt.Bin(maxbins=30)`
to the `bin` parameter instead of passing the value `True`.
