# Creating bar charts and histograms

Notes:
In this module
we will be learning how to create bars charts for counting observations,
and a special types of bar chars called histograms
for showing distributions of data.

---

## Subsetting the global development data

```{python}
import pandas as pd

gm = pd.read_csv('data/world-data-gapminder.csv', parse_dates=['year'])
gm2018 = gm[gm['year'] == '2018']
gm2018
```

Notes:
In this slide deck,
we will continue to work with the gapminder dataset.

To make it more suitable for this slide deck
let's subset it to include observations from the year 2018 only.

When filtering on a date in pandas,
we can either type out just the year portion
or the entire date string in the format shown in the slide.

---

## Creating a bar chart of the total population per continent

```{python}
import altair as alt

alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x='region',
    y=alt.Y('sum(population)', title='Population'))
```

Notes:
Bar charts are often avoided when visualizing summary statistics
where it is important to display the variation in the raw data.

This is the case for measures of central tendency,
such as the mean and median,
which are better represented with other visualizations
that we will cover later in the course.

Bar chart are a good choice for representing individual values,
such as the number of people living in a country
at a specific point in time.

Some summary statistics are displayed as single values,
such as counts of observations and summations,
and bar charts are suitable for these as well.

We will talk more about how to best represent summary statistics 
and variation in raw data when we learn about distributions
in the next module.

Here we are answering the question
"How many people live in each continent?",
by creating a bar chart of a single value per continent
representing the sum of the populations from the countries in that region.

We can see that more than half the world's population is living in Asia,
and almost twice as many people live in Africa compared to Europe.

---

## Horizontal bar charts are made by switching the x and y encoding

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('sum(population)', title='Population'),
    y='region')
```

Notes:
If we switched x and y,
we would create a horizontal bar chart instead.

Although vertical bar charts are more commonly seen,
horizontal bar charts are preferred
when the labels on the categorical axis
become so long that they need to be rotated
to be readable in a vertical bar chart.

Since this is the case for our plot,
we will continue to use horizontal bar charts
in this slide deck.

---

## Visualizing counts of values with bar charts

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x='count()',
    y='region')
```

Notes:
What if we wanted to know how many countries there were within each continent?

Since we already have filtered the data to contain only values from a single year,
we know that each country will only occur once in the dataset.

So to answer this question,
we could count the number of observations/rows in the dataframe
for each continent.

To count observations in Altair,
we can use the aggregation function `count()`.

We don't need to specify a column name for the y-axis,
since we are just counting values in each categorical group on the y-axis.

---

## Setting the axis title clarifies what we are visualizing

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y='region')
```

Notes:
The default axis value for counts is "Count of Records",
where "records" is another name for "observations".

As previously,
we can clarify what we are visualizing by setting a title.

What if we wanted to know how many countries there were within each continent?

Since we already have filtered the data to contain only values from a single year,
we know that each country will only occur once in the dataset.

So to answer this question,
we could count the number of observations/rows in the dataframe
for each continent.

To count observations in Altair,
we can use the aggregation function `count()`.

We don't need to specify a column name for the y-axis,
since we are just counting observations
in each `region`.

In the resulting chart,
we can see that Africa and Asia has the most individual countries,
whereas Oceania has the fewest.

---

## Ordering bars makes them easier to interpret

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y=alt.Y('region', sort='x'))
```

Notes:
By default,
Altair sorts categorical values in alphabetical order.

For most data,
it becomes easier to interpret if the bars are sorted 
from high to low values.
An exception to this guidelines is
if the categorical axis has a natural order to it,
such as weekdays, months, etc.

This makes it easier to see trends in the data,
and to compare bars of similar height more accurately.

To sort the bars,
we will use the helper functions `alt.X` and `alt.Y` again.

As with all arguments passed to Python functions,
we can leave out the parameter names (`x=` and `y=`)
if we pass the arguments in the order they are defined in the function signature.

In this example,
we're typing `sort='x'` to specify that we want to sort
according to the values on the y-axis.

When sorting by value,
it is often more visually appealing with the longest bar
the closet to the axis line,
as in this slide.

---

## The longest bar should be the closest to the axis line

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y=alt.Y('region', sort='-x'))
```

Notes:
If we for some reason would want the reverse order,
we could use the minus sign before the axis reference.
This can be helpful in cases where you are making a vertical bar chart,
since it would then align the tallest bar next to the y-axis.

---

## A custom order can be used for the sort

```{python}
my_order = ['Africa', 'Europe', 'Oceania', 'Asia', 'Americas']
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('count()', title='Number of countries'),
    y=alt.Y('region', sort=my_order))
```

Notes:
Sometimes there is a natural order to the values on the categorical axis
that we want to use for the bars,
for example days of the week
or months of the year.

For situations like this,
we can pass a list or array
to the `sort` parameter.

We can either create this list manually as we did in this slide,
or use the pandas sort function if we 
for example wanted to sort in reverse alphabetical order.

To learn more about important considerations
when plotting counts of categorical observations,
you can refer to [chapter 6 of Fundamental of Data Visualizations](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/visualizing-amounts.html).

---

## Using bars to show counts of quantitative variables

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('life_expectancy'),
    y='count()')
```

Notes:
So far we have been counting observations in categorical groups
(the continents).

Another common use of bar charts
is to visualize the range
and frequency/count of the values in our data.
This is often referred to as estimating the "distribution" of the data,
which we will talk more about in the next module.

This type of chart is so common that it has its own name: histogram.

In our data,
we might want to answer the question
"How long do people around the world live?"
or in other words
"What is the distribution of life expectancy for different countries?".

If we create a histogram directly for the numerical values
its appearance would be very spiky,
as you can see in this slide.

This happens because there are very few values that are exactly the same.

For example,
values like 67.2, 69.3, 69.5, etc,
would all get their own bar
instead of being in the same bar
representing the interval 65-70.

If we had ordinal/ordinal values,
such as the numbers on a dice,
then it would make sense to have one bar per value on the dice,
but in the case of quantitative/continuous data
as we have here,
this is not a good strategy.

---

## In a histogram each bar represents a range of values

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('life_expectancy', bin=True),
    y='count()')
```

Notes:
Instead,
we want to create intervals or "bins"
that represent ranges of numerical values
and then count all the observations within each of these ranges.

To enable binning of the x-axis in Altair,
we can set `bin=True` inside `alt.X`.

This automatically calculates a suitable number of bins,
and counts up all the values within each group
before plotting a bar representing this count.

In contrast to bar charts,
it is rarely beneficial to make horizontal histograms
since the labels are numbers which don't need to be rotated to be readable.

You can also see that we have not changed the title of the y-axis.
There isn't really any more informative title we can substitute for here,
since the length of each bar simply represents the count of observations/records in each bin.

Now it is easier to see where the life expectancy of the countries fall.
We can see that most countries seem to have a life expectancy between 75 and 80 years,
and that only very few have one under 60.
However,
these conclusions will depend on exactly how wide our bins are,
which we will talk more about in the next module.

---

## Narrower bins increase the resolution along the axis

```{python}
alt.Chart(gm2018).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('life_expectancy', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=20), title='Life expectancy'),
    y='count()')
```

Notes:
Although the automatically calculated number of bins is often appropriate,
we might sometimes want to increase the resolution 
of our visualization by have narrower bins.

We can change the number of bins by passing `alt.Bin(maxbins=30)`
to the `bin` parameter instead of passing the value `True`.

Note that you will not get the exact number of bins,
Altair will find a number than aligns well with the axis ticks
within the max you specified
(the `step` parameter can be used to set and exact bin width if desired).

Here we also changed the title because "binned" 
is not really necessary
and it is largely clear from the axis already that each bar spans a range of numbers.

We will talk more about histograms
and other ways to represent distributions in the next module,
but it is important to remember that they are just a bar chart
on a binned axis.
