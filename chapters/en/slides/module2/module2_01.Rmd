# Visual encoding channels

Notes:
So far we have seen how to use points and lines to represent data visually.
In this lecture,
we will see how we can also use areas and bars for this purpose.
But before we dive in to the code,
let's talk about which visual channels are the most effective
at graphically representing data.

## Comparing sizes is easier for some geometrical objects than for others

![](/module2/circle-comparison.png)

Notes:
As with many aspect,
the best way to learn is to experience
rather than being told something.
So lets experience which visual encodings are the most effective.

In the image in this slide,
try to estimate how many times bigger the big circle is compared to the small one.

## Both the circles and rectangles differ by 7x

![](/module2/7x.png){width=60%}

Notes:
In both cases the answer is seven times bigger.
Most people find it is much easier to compare the length or position of the bars
rather than the area of the circles.
And for the circles,
you also didn't really know
if you were supposed to compare the area or maybe the diameter.
The examples on the previous two slides
is from [Jeffrey Heer's PyData talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsfWtPH2kDg),
a visualization researcher at the university of Washington
whose research group also created Altair.

## Summary of visual channel efficiency

![](/module2/visual-channels-rank.png){width=80%}

Notes:
Even if you got both these right yourself,
the fact that many people prefer one over the other
means that in order for you to create effective visualizations
you need to know which visual channels are the easiest for humans to decode.
Luckily,
there has been plenty of research in this area,
which can be summarizes in the schematic on this slide.

Position is by far the best
and therefore we should put our most important comparison there.
Using position often means that we can't use other things such as length
or angle (like the angle in a pie chart),
but we can add size or color to represent other relationships.
Even if it is hard to tell exact information from these
(is this color/dot 2x darker/bigger than another?)
they are good to give and idea of trends in the data
(are these dots darker/bigger than the others?

## Don't use 3D without a good reason

### Unnecessary 3D makes plot interpretation harder

![](/module2/bad-3d-barchart.png)

Notes:
The biggest issues with using 3D is when it is used unnecessarily (like a 3D bar or pie chart),
as the only way to compare position (like a 3D scatter plot),
and when they are represented on a 2D medium like a paper
where they can't be rotated.
In this slide we see a 3D bar chart,
where it looks like the values of the bars
are around A=0.7, B=1.7, C=2.7 and D=3.7.
However,
this is only because of the angle of the camera in the plot,
the actual values here of A, B, C, and D
are actually 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

## Meaningful 3D can facilitate plot interpretation

![](https://media.github.ubc.ca/user/1751/files/da4e1b00-0fd3-11eb-940d-0b06a28a0186)

Notes:
Sometimes 3D can be useful,
like a topographical map or a protein folding visualization.
But be cautious,
we saw above that even in naturally 3D systems like blood vessels
it is still mentally more complex when they are 3D.
[Claus Wilke's has a good chapter](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/no-3d.html) on this
if you are interested to read more.

There is also some [interesting work done with the Rayshader library](https://www.tylermw.com/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader/)
that maps 3D in an intuitive way and incorporates reasonable camera rotation around the objects.
This slide contains is an example of visualizing the bend in space time via the 3D depth channel,
eliminating the need for an additional 2D plot.

## Properly designed visualizations help saving lives

![](/module2/blood-vessels-40.png)

Notes:
How much these best practices actually matters
might be a bit abstract
until you gain personal experience from it,
Therefore,
I want to include a concrete example
of how changing visualization method improved an important clinical outcome.

Heart disease is the most common cause of death,
yearly killing almost 9 million people,
or as many as diabetes, dementia, neonatal conditions respiratory infections
all together.
By detecting regions of low shear stress in the arteries around the heart,
doctors are able to identify patients that are on their way to develop heart disease
and take action early to improve the patient's survival chances.
To evaluate the shear stress in the arteries,
the regular practice is to use a digital 3D representation of the artery
colored according to the amount of sheer stress
which is what you can see in this picture.
The colormap changes from blue for the areas of interest (low stress)
to cyan, green, yellow, and red for higher stress.

A few years ago,
a research group set out to test how effective this type of visualization was
compared to a couple of alternatives.
When using the visualization you see in this slide,
about 40% of the areas of low shear stress
were correctly identified by doctors.

---

## Changing the color scale almost doubled the accuracy

![](/module2/blood-vessels-70.png)

Notes:
The first thing this research group tested
was the effect of testing the color scale to one that is easier to interpret
and makes the important areas of low shear stress stand out more,
since they are highlighted in a bright red color,
and the rest are in black and white.
By this seemingly small modification,
they identified that the percentage of correct analysis almost doubled,
from 40% to 70%.
We will talk more about choosing correct color scales at the later modules of this course.

---

## Changing from 3D to 2D improved the further accuracy

![](/module2/blood-vessels-90.png)

Notes:
The next modification the researcher tested
was to change from a 3D representation of the blood vessels to a 2D representation.
Although a 3D representation is more anatomically correct here,
it is also more cognitively demanding for us to process,
and some areas can cover others
so it is harder to get a quick overview of the vessels.
In the 2D visualization,
the blood vessels and their branching points
are shown in a schematic that is less cognitively demanding to interpret.
This representation was also shown to be more effective,
as 90% of the low shear stress areas were now correctly identified.

Overall,
these two tweaks more than doubled the outcome accuracy,
from 40% to 90%.
A huge increase from modification
that might have seemed to be a mere matter of taste unless you knew visualization theory!
So, if anyone tells you that visualization of data is not as important as other components,
you can tell them about this study
and ask them what kind of visualization
they want their doctor to look at
when analysing their arteries.
