Notes: 

So far we have seen how to use points and lines to represent data visually.

In this lecture, we will see how we can also use areas and bars for this purpose.

Before we dive into the code, let's discuss how different visual channels,
such as position, area, etc, can impact how easy it is for us
to accurately interpret the plotted data.

As in many cases,
an efficient way to learn this topic is through personal experience.

Please follow along in the exercises on the next two slides
to see which visual channels you find the most effective.

## Comparing sizes is easier for some geometrical objects than for others

In the image in this slide,
try to estimate how many times larger the big circle is compared to the small one.

## Both the circles and rectangles differ by 7x

<br>

<center><img src="/module2/7x.png"  width="80%"></center>

Notes:
In both cases, the answer is seven times bigger.
Even if you guessed both of these exactly correct,
most people find it is much easier to compare the length or position of the bars
rather than the area of the circles.

For the circles,
you might even have hesitated at exactly what to compare
when we said "how many time *larger*",
were you supposed to compare the area or the diameter?

This is less ambiguous for bars as long as their widths are kept the same.

This is important to keep in mind,
especially when communicating to others via visualization,
but also when creating plots for yourself.

These two examples are originally from [Jeffrey Heer's PyData talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsfWtPH2kDg),
who is a visualization researcher at the University of Washington
and whose research group created the D3 and VegaLite packages
which Altair is based on.

## Summary of visual channel efficiency

<center><img src="/module2/visual-channels-rank.png"  width="80%"></center>


Notes:
Even if you got both these right yourself,
the fact that many people prefer one over the other
means that in order for you to create effective visualizations
you need to know which visual channels are the easiest for humans to decode.

Luckily,
there has been plenty of research in this area,
which can be summarized in the schematic on this slide.

Position is by far the best
and therefore we should put our most important comparison there.

Using position often means that we can't use other things such as length
or angle (like the angle in a pie chart),
but we can add size or colour to represent other relationships.

Even if it is hard to tell exact information from these
(is this colour/dot 2x darker/bigger than another?)
they are good to give an idea of trends in the data.

## Don't use 3D without a good reason

### Unnecessary 3D makes plot interpretation harder


<center><img src="/module2/bad-3d-barchart.png"></center>

Notes:
The biggest issue with using 3D is when it is used unnecessarily (like a 3D bar or pie chart),
as the only way to compare position (like a 3D scatter plot),
and when they are represented on a 2D medium like a paper
where they can't be rotated.

In this slide, we see a 3D bar chart,
where it looks like the values of the bars
are around A=0.7, B=1.7, C=2.7 and D=3.7.

However,
this is only because of the angle of the camera in the plot,
the actual values here of A, B, C, and D
are actually 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

## Meaningful 3D can facilitate plot interpretation

Notes:
Sometimes 3D can be useful,
like a topographical map or a protein folding visualization.

In this slide, you can see the [interesting work is done with the Rayshader library](https://www.tylermw.com/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader/)
that maps in 3D in an intuitive way
that incorporates reasonable camera rotation around the objects.

The example to the right visualizes the bend in space-time via 3D position (depth),
eliminating the need for an additional 2D plot as in the example to the left.

But be cautious,
we will see in the next slides that even in systems such as blood vessels,
which are naturally organized in three dimensions,
it is still mentally more complex to interpret a 3D visualization accurately.

[Researcher Claus Wilke's has authored a good chapter](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/no-3d.html) on this topic
if you are interested to learn more.

## Properly designed visualizations help saving lives

<center><img src="/module2/blood-vessels-40.png"  width="40%"></center>

Notes:
How much these best practices actually matters
might be a bit abstract until you gain personal experience from it, therefore, I want to include a concrete example
of how changing visualization methods improved an important clinical outcome.

Heart disease is the most common cause of death,
yearly killing almost 9 million people,
or as many as diabetes, dementia, neonatal conditions respiratory infections
all together.

By detecting regions of low shear stress in the arteries around the heart,
doctors can identify patients that are on their way to develop heart disease
and take action early to improve the patient's survival chances.

To evaluate the shear stress in the arteries,
the regular practice is to use a digital 3D representation of the artery
coloured according to the amount of shear stress
which is what you can see in this picture.

The colormap changes from blue for the areas of interest (low stress)
to cyan, green, yellow, and red for higher stress.

A few years ago,
a research group set out to test how effective this type of visualization was
compared to a couple of alternatives.

When using the visualization you see in this slide,
about 40% of the areas of low shear stress
were correctly identified by doctors.

## Changing the colour scale almost doubled the accuracy

<center><img src="/module2/blood-vessels-70.png"  width="40%"></center>

Notes:
The first thing this research group tested
was the effect of testing the colour scale to one that is easier to interpret
and makes the important areas of low shear stress stand out more,
since they are highlighted in a bright red colour,
and the rest are in black and white.

By this seemingly small modification,
they identified that the percentage of correct analysis almost doubled,
from 40% to 70%.

We will talk more about choosing the correct colour scales in the later modules of this course.

---

## Changing from 3D to 2D improved the further accuracy

<center><img src="/module2/blood-vessels-90.png"  width="50%"></center>

Notes:
The next modification the researcher tested
was to change from a 3D representation of the blood vessels to a 2D representation.

Although a 3D representation is more anatomically correct here,
it is also more cognitively demanding for us to process,
and some areas can cover others
so it is harder to get a quick overview of the vessels.

In the 2D visualization,
the blood vessels and their branching points
are shown in a schematic that is less cognitively demanding to interpret.
This representation was also shown to be more effective,
as 90% of the low shear stress areas were now correctly identified.

Overall,
these two tweaks more than doubled the outcome accuracy,
from 40% to 90%.

A huge increase from modification
that might have seemed to be a mere matter of taste unless you knew visualization theory!

So, if anyone tells you that visualization of data is not as important as other components,
you can tell them about this study
and ask them what kind of visualization
they want their doctor to look at
when analyzing their arteries.
