# Visual encoding channels

Notes:
So far we have seen how to use points and lines to represent data visually.
In this lecture,
we will see how we can also use areas and bars for this purpose.
But before we dive in to the code,
let's talk about which visual channels are the most effective
at graphically representing data.

## Comparing sizes is easier for some geometrical objects than for others

Notes:
As with many aspect,
the best way to learn is to experience
rather than being told something.
So lets experience which visual encodings are the most effective.

In the image in this slide,
try to estimate how many times bigger the big circle is compared to the small one.
