# Figure composition

Notes:
In this module we will see how we layout plots together
instead of showing only one at a time.

## Loading in the data

```{python echo=FALSE}
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
from vega_datasets import data

state_map = alt.topo_feature(data.us_10m.url, 'states')
state_pop = pd.read_csv('data/us_population_and_coordinates.csv')

choropleth = (alt.Chart(state_map).mark_geoshape().transform_lookup(
    lookup='id',
    from_=alt.LookupData(state_pop, 'id', ['population']))
.encode(color='population:Q')
.project(type='albersUsa')).properties(height=200, width=300)

us_map = (alt.Chart(state_map).mark_geoshape(color='lightgray', stroke='white')
          .project(type='albersUsa'))

points = alt.Chart(state_pop).mark_circle().encode(
    longitude='longitude',
    latitude='latitude',
    size='population')

points_on_map = us_map + points
```

Notes:
On this slide we are recreating the choropleth and pointplot map
from the end of the last slide deck.
We are saving these as variables so that we can use them to practice
laying out plots on the following slides.

TODO fix so that this code shows up correctly on the slide

---

## Placing plots next to each other allows us to make more direct comparisons

```{python}
choropleth | points_on_map
```

Notes:
To place plot side by side,
vi can use the pipe (`|`) operator.
You have already seen us using this occasionally in previous modules.

We could also have used the `alt.hconcat(choropleth, points_on_map)`,
but it takes less typing to use the operator.

We can see that the legends are stacked to the right of both plots.

---

## Plots can also be concatenated vertically

```{python}
choropleth & points_on_map
```

Notes:
To place plots next to each other vertically,
we can use the ampersand (`&`) operator.

We could also have used the `alt.vconcat(choropleth, points_on_map)`,
but it takes less typing to use the operator.

---

## Vertical and horizontal concatenation can be combined

```{python}
bars = alt.Chart(state_pop).mark_bar().encode(
    y='population',
    x=alt.Y('state', sort='y', title=None),
    color='population').properties(height=100, width=625)

points_on_map | choropleth & bars
```

Notes:
Often we want to create more complex figure layouts
where plots are concatenated both horizontally and vertically.
This allow to present relevant information next to each other
and can be useful if there is a key comparison we want to make
between multiple slots on a single slide
instead of flipping between slides
which can be harder to follow.

In Altair,
we can create the figure layout
by combining the vertical and the horizontal concatenation operators.

In this slide,
we create a barplot of the population in each state
that we want to place under the two maps.
But as we can see in this slide,
this places the barplot under only the rightmost map.
Why is that?

---

## Parentheses can be used to indicate groupings in complex layouts

```{python}
bars = alt.Chart(state_pop).mark_bar().encode(
    y='population',
    x=alt.Y('state', sort='y', title=None),
    color='population').properties(height=100, width=625)

(points_on_map | choropleth) & bars
```

Notes:
The reason the plot in the previous slide did not looks as we desired
is that the `&` operator has higher priority than `|`,
so the choropleth and barplot are first vertically concatenated
before being horizontally concatenated to the point map.

We want the horizontal concatenation between the maps 
to occur first
and just like with mathematical expression,
we can use parenthesis to indicate 
which operations should have priority.

You can see an example of that in this slide,
where we get the barplot to show up below both the maps
as desired.

---

## Titles can be added to each level of the layout

```{python}
centered_map_title = alt.TitleParams(text='Map comparison', anchor='middle')
((points_on_map | choropleth) .properties(title=centered_map_title) & bars).properties(title='US population by state')
```

Notes:
To make our visualization easier to interpret,
we can add descriptive titles.
These are often particularly important when we create more complex figures
since there are now several panels within each figure to keep track of.

This doesn't mean that each panel absolutely needs a title,
but when in doubt it is better to add one title too many than one too few.
