# Comparing many distributions

Notes:
To compare multiple distributions
we have seen have we can use faceting for histograms
and either faceting or coloring for density plots.

So far we only studied these plots
with up to three different distributions to compare,
but what if we had many more that,
such as 10, 20 or even 50?

---

## The extended movies dataset

```{python}
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

movies_extended = data.movies().dropna(subset=['Major Genre'])
movies_extended
```

Notes:
For this exercise we will use an extended movies dataset
containing additional genres.

We load in that dataset from the vega sample repository
and drop all the rows that have an NaN value in the column `"Major Genre"`,
since we are only interested in comparing the movies 
that we know belong to a genre.

The question we will try to answer in this slide deck is
"Which genres have the highest worldwide gross?".

---

## Many distributions can't be effectively compared with histograms

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),
    alt.Y('count()'),
    alt.Color('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
As we have seen,
histograms are not very effective for comparing multiple distributions,
and not at all with this many different groups.

Most genres have a low worldwide gross
and because our histograms are stacked on top of each other
the left-most bar dominates with around 2000 movies.
It extends the y-axis so that it is hard to see 
how many observations there are for highest x-values
(but we know there are some since the axis extends that far).

---

## Many distributions can't be effectively compared with densities either

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_area().transform_density(
    'Worldwide Gross',
    groupby=['Major Genre'],
    as_=['Worldwide Gross', 'density'])
 .encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('density:Q'),
    alt.Color('Major Genre')))
```

Notes:
Although we saw previously that a layered density chart
is better than a stacked histogram,
it is not effective in comparing this many distributions either.
Particularly not when the bulk of the distribution is concentrated in a small area,
such as the low x-values in this plot.

This density chart shares many of the issues with the histogram from the previous slide,
and this visualization is a poor choice for our data.

We could try faceting vertically with one density or histogram per facets,
but there would be a lot of subplots with this many genres
and they might not be that easy to compare when they are in facets far apart.

So how can we create an effective comparison between all the genres?

---

## Bar charts are effective for comparing a single value per group but hides variation

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('mean(Worldwide Gross)'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
We could use a barplot if we were only interested in comparing a single value
from each distribution,
such as the mean or median.

However,
this is generally not a good idea
because any plot that only shows a single value from a distribution
will hide the variation in the data,
which could lead us to arrive at incorrect conclusions
as you will see in the next slide.

[Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128)

Notes:
This image illustrates how the same bar chart (A)
could have been generated from three different distributions (B, C, or D).

If we just looked at the bar chart,
we could not tell which of the distributions it came from,
but looking at the points directly
we would arrive at widely different conclusion
regarding our data.

In sample B,
the points seem to on average be slightly different between the two groups,
although there is significant overlap between the distributions.

In sample C there seems to be one outlier data point
that increases the mean significantly for its group,
but most of the other points are pretty similar between the two groups.

In D, both groups have their data distributed bimodally (in two peaks).
Maybe this means that there is a third group in this data which all the high values belong too?

All this valuable information about our data,
is lost when visualizing it as a bar chart.
Remember,
bar charts are best suited for displaying individual values
such as counts, proportions, and sums.

To arrive at more accurate conclusions
we need to present a richer representation of the data
such as a histogram or a density plot,
which are great as long as we don't have too many distributions to compare.

But which visualizations could we use to accurately represent the distributions
while still remaining effective for comparing many distributions
in the same plot?

---

## Showing individual observations gives a richer representation than bar charts

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_tick().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
One approach would be to show the individual observations,
such as in this chart.
This is a compact plot,
which makes it easy to compare the different genres,
since they are close to each other in the chart.

We can also clearly see the reason for why the x-axis goes up to such a large max value:
There are two movies that grossed highly above the rest!

Which are these movies?

---

## Tooltips are helpful for answering questions about specific observations

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_tick().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'),
    alt.Tooltip('Title:N'))
```

Notes:
Altair really shines in answering questions like this!
In addition to having a robust visualization grammar,
it also provides a grammar for interactive features.

We will dive deep into more complex interactivity
in the last module in this course,
but for now we can simply add a tooltip
and answer the question we just posed
by hovering with the mouse over the two highly grossing movies.
Try it!

(We need the `:N` because there are some title values
that makes Altair not recognize this dataframe variable as nominal otherwise)

Although this visualization is useful
in getting information about the individual movies,
it is hard to tell exactly how many data points
there are in the areas that are completely blue.
Is there just enough so that we don't see any of the white background
or are there thousands of observations stacked on top of each other?

This plot is saturated,
something we will discuss in detail in the next module.
We could use transparency to alleviate this issue to some extend,
but it is more effective to use color for representing the counts,
such as in a heatmap.

---

## Heatmaps can compare multiple distributions without saturation

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_rect().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=100)),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'),
    alt.Color('count()')))
```

Notes:
A heatmap of the number of observations
is very similar to a histogram,
but the count is mapped to the color
instead of to the height on the y-axis.

This heatmap shows the histogram
for each of the genres right next to each other
so that they are easy to compare and contrast,
by looking at the varying colors.

We can see that some genres appear to have most of their observations
close to zero,
such as Comedy and Drama,
whereas others are more spread out,
such as Adventure movies.

This is a pretty effective visualization,
but since the color scale is the same for each genre
and some genres have many more observations than others,
it can be difficult to accurately interpret
the distribution of those genres that have few observations.

For example, 
we wouldn't be able to distinguish
between regions with 10-20 and 40-50 observations
since the colors are so similar.

Remember that comparing positions is more effective 
than than comparing colors,
so how can we use position to compare multiple distributions?

## Boxplots show several key statistic from a distribution

<center><img src=/module3/boxplot-schematic.png></img></center>

[Jhguch at en.wikipedia via Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boxplot_vs_PDF.svg)

Notes:
A boxplot is a mix between showing individual values
and a few key summary statistics.

Instead of showing just the mean or median as with a bar plot,
a box plot shows 5 summary statistics.

The box represents three values,
the median in the middle and the upper and lower quartile at the edges
This means that means that 50% of the data points lie within the box.

The lines extending from the box are called whiskers
and they can represent a few different statistics.
Sometimes,
they are showing the min and the max (the range) of our data.

However,
it is more common that they show the furthest points that are still within
1.5 x the "interquartile" range from the edges of the box.
The interquartile range is the distance between the edges of the box.

Conventionally,
any observations that fall outside the whiskers,
are drawn out as individual points and are sometimes referred to as "outliers",
which are occasionally discarded.

However,
what really is an outlier in your data and what you should do with them
depends on the question you are asking.
Maybe these data points are the most important in your dataset
or they could be measurement errors.
You should always look further and think carefully before discarding data as outliers.

How does it look when we use boxplots
to answer our question?

---

## Boxplots can effectively compare multiple distributions

```{python}
bar = alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('mean(Worldwide Gross)'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
    
box = alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))

box | bar
```

Notes:
Here we show a boxplot next to the barplot we created initially.
The `|` operator works similarly to the `+` operator,
but instead of layering charts on top of each other,
it puts them next to each other.

We can see that the box plots provides us with the same clear positional comparison
as in the barplot,
but we now also has access to additional information
about each genres' distribution.
We can ensure ourselves that the distributions are roughly the same shape 
and view potential outliers.

We can directly answer the question we posed at the beginning:
the Adventure genre generates the highest revenue
both in terms of the medians and the overall position of the boxes.

It seems like Action is the second most highly grossing genre,
but after that it becomes hard to compare.
We could make this visualization even more effective
by sorting the boxes according to their median value.

---

## Sorted boxplots more effective for comparing similar distributions

```{python}
genre_order = movies_extended.groupby('Major Genre')['Worldwide Gross'].median().sort_values().index.tolist()
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre', sort=genre_order))
```

Notes:
Altair does not support sorting boxplots via the "x" or "-x" shortcut.

Instead we need to create a list of the genres,
ordered by value.

We can do this with pandas by grouping the dataframe, computing the median for the grossing columns,
sorting the values, and then extracting the index as a list.

Now the visualization is very effective!
It is easy to compare genres with similar grossing
since they are right next to each other in the plot.

If we wanted to look closer at the differences
between the bulk of the distributions
we could exclude the two most highly grossing movies.

---

## Zooming in facilitates comparison of small differences

```{python}
filtered_movies = movies_extended[movies_extended['Worldwide Gross'] < 1_500_000_000]
alt.Chart(filtered_movies).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre', sort=genre_order))
```

Notes:
Here we can compare the distributions more clearly,
and it really looks like there is no large differences
in the medians between the five genres
behind Adventure and Action.

We will need to keep in mind that there are two additional data points
that we have excluded from this visualization,
but neither the median line nor the box would be much affected 
by excluding just a few values from a large population.

If we would have shown the mean instead of the median,
this could have been an issue
since the mean can be affected significantly
from just a few extreme values.

---

## Boxplots can be scaled by the number of observations

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre', sort=genre_order),
    alt.Size('count()'))
```

Notes:
The size of the boxes can be made proportional to the count of observations
in that group.

This helps us see if there are many more observations 
underlying some of the boxes versus others.
In our plot,
we can see that the "comedy" genre has the most movies
whereas there are few documentaries and black comedies.

However,
it also makes it hard to tell where the lines of the median
and the boxes are for many of the distributions.
A better alternative could be to not scale the boxes
and instead include a bar chart with the number of observations per genre
together with the boxplot.

## Boxplots are not able to accurately represent data with multiple peaks


<center><img src=/module3/point-box-violin.gif</img></center>

[From Autodesk research](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs)

Notes:
While boxplots are effective for visualizing multiple distributions,
they also have their shortcomings.

One of their main downsides
is that they are not effective in showing distributions with multiple peaks.
This can be seen in the animation in this slide,
where variation in the raw data does no result in any change in the boxplots.

Two effective visualizations for many distributions that
also handle multiple peaks are
[violin plots](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/violin_plot.html)
(as shown in this slide)
and [stripplots](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/stripplot.html).

Violinplots are similar to density plots put next to each other,
and stripplots prevent overlap
by distributing the points in a cloud instead of a straight line.

There are also [sina plots](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sinaplot/vignettes/SinaPlot.html),
which combine the best of violin plots and strip plots together.

These are all highly effective,
but not yet available to make easily in Altair,
so we will not be teaching them here.

Boxplots are still very effective in comparing multiple distributions,
and when there are even more distributions than what we have here,
e.g. 50+,
then boxplots are often easier to interpret than the alternatives mentions above,
since they are simpler.
