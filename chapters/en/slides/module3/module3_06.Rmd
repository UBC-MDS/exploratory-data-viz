# Using density plots to visualize distributions

<head>
    <base target="_blank">
</head>

Notes:
In this module we will see how to use density plots
instead of histograms to represent distributions of data.

## Histograms can give different results depending on the data

<center><img src=/module3/histogram-and-shifted.png></img></center>

[From scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neighbors/plot_kde_1d.html)

Notes:
How many observations are counted per bar in a histogram
depends on exactly where on the axis the border between the bins are.

In the images on this slide,
the actual observations are drawn with black tick marks on the bottom
and they are the same in both subplots.

The reason the histograms look different
is that the border between the groups is shifted in the rightmost picture.

As we see here,
a histogram is not an as unbiased plot as we might think at first,
especially not if we have few data points,
where the inclusion or exclusion of just a few points
makes a big difference for the bar height.

---

## Centering the bins on the data can help create more accurate distribution plots

<center><img src=/module3/kde-buildup.gif></img></center>

Notes:
Instead of setting fixed lines along the axis
and then counting points fully in one bin or another,
we can create bins that are centred
on the data and then add them together.

When we center bins on the data,
we also usually have a rounded shape 
instead of a square one.

This gives the impression of a smoother distribution
that is more conducive to communicating the shape of the data distribution.

The round bins (also called kernels)
are then added together as shown like we see in this slide's animation,
and them sum up to an overall distribution line.

Formally,
this is called a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE),
or just a density plot.

## The movies dataset

```{python}
import pandas as pd


movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
movies
```

Notes:
We will be using the movies dataset again.

Let's see if we can make a plot
that is easier to interpret
than the layered histograms
from the end of the last slide deck.

## Creating a density plot in Altair required two step

```{python}
import altair as alt

(alt.Chart(movies).transform_density(
    'runtime',
    as_=['runtime', 'density'])  # Give a name to the KDE values, which we can use when plotting
 .mark_area().encode(
    x='runtime',
    y='density:Q'))
```

Notes:
To visualize a density plot,
we need to do two things:

1. Calculate the KDE (adding the individual kernels and summing them together)
2. Plot a line or area mark for the newly calculated KDE values.

In Altair,
these operations are done in two explicit steps,
using `transform_density` for the calculation.

We could also have calculated this as a new column in our pandas data frame
and then plotted that column,
but it is convenient to do both the steps in Altair.

The new variable we create is called `'density'`,
and since this is not part of the pandas data frame,
Altair cannot ask pandas which data type it is.
Therefore,
we need to add `':Q'` to indicate that the density has quantitative (numeric) values.

---

## Creating a grouped density plot requires an explicit density grouping

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies).transform_density(
     'runtime',
     groupby=['genre'],
     as_=['runtime', 'density'])
 .mark_area().encode(
     x='runtime',
     y='density:Q',
     color='genre'))
```

Notes:
If we want to split and color the densities
by a categorical variable,
we need to add an explicit `groupby` column
when calculating the density.
This computes one density 
per colour variable (`genre` in this case),
that will then be coloured accordingly
since we used the same variable for the colour argument.

In this plot,
it is quite easy to see the relationship between movie lengths of different genres.
The history genre has the longest running movies
as well as the most variation
whereas most animation moves are shorter
and with less spread within the genre.

There are still a few things we could tweak to improve this plot!

---

## Creating smoother density plots with more calculation steps

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies).transform_density(
     'runtime',
     groupby=['genre'],
     as_=['runtime', 'density'],
     steps=200)
 .mark_area().encode(
     x='runtime',
     y='density:Q',
     color='genre'))
```

Notes:
To make the curves smoother,
we can increase the resolution
over which the KDE is calculated
by setting the step size to a higher number.

Now there will be 200 points calculated,
which gives the area a smoother appearance.

---

## Making the overlapping areas slightly transparent make them easier to interpret

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies).transform_density(
     'runtime',
     groupby=['genre'],
     as_=['runtime', 'density'],
     steps=200)
 .mark_area(opacity=0.4).encode(
     x='runtime',
     y='density:Q',
     color='genre'))
```

Notes:
The density areas don't suffer the same issues as the histograms when made transparent.
The continuous solid shape is easier to follow
even when it is semi transparent and
overlaps with the other areas.

The transparency gives us the advantage
of knowing that there is not small density area hiding behind a bigger one.

---

## The y-axis does not indicate a meaningful value for density plots

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies).transform_density(
     'runtime',
     groupby=['genre', 'country'],
     as_=['runtime', 'density'])
 .mark_area().encode(
     x='runtime',
     y='density:Q',
     color='genre')
 .properties(height=265).facet('country'))
```

Notes:
If we facet these,
you will notice that they look quite different from the faceted histograms
in the previous slide deck.

This is because the density rather than the count is shown by default on the y-axis.
Showing the density means that it is easier for us to compare the shape of the distributions
but is not really a useful numbers for us to know.

---

## Density plots of small datasets can be misleading

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies[:10]).transform_density(
    'runtime',
    as_=['runtime', 'density'])  # Give a name to the KDE values, which we can use when plotting
 .mark_area().encode(
    x='runtime',
    y='density:Q'))
```

Notes:
Since density plots don't show the number of observations,
they can be very misleading for small data sets
as they will still appear smooth
as if there were many data points to back up that smoothness.

When looking at this plot,
are you be able to tell that
the density is made up of just ten observations?

It is a little bit easier in Altair to see this,
because the default is to end the density where the data ends,
which often creates sharp bordered edges, like we see in this plot.

This is a great default in Altair,
but many other plotting packages
instead extend the density beyond the observations in the dataset
to make it more smooth
and it is therefore paramount
to always ask how many observations there are
before interpreting a density plot.

---

## The density can be scaled by the count

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies).transform_density(
     'runtime',
     groupby=['genre', 'country'],
     as_=['runtime', 'density'],
     counts=True)
 .mark_area().encode(
     x='runtime',
     y='density:Q',
     color='genre')
 .properties(height=240).facet('country'))
```

Notes:
In Altair,
we could actually scale the density plots by the count of observations,
which does make the y-axis easier to interpret.

This, however only gives an indication of how many observations there are
for different parts of the density
and it is not as easy to interpret this y-value
as in a histogram where there is and exact count in each discrete bin.

Although densities can be scaled by count,
they rarely are,
which means we must be careful when interpreting them
and always check how many observations are in the data!
