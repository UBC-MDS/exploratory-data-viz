# Overfitting and underfitting

Notes: <br>

---

We're going to think about 3 types of errors:

- **score_train**:  is our training score (or mean train score from cross-validation).

<br>

- **score_valid**  is our validation score (or mean validation score from cross-validation).

<br>

- **score_test**  is our test score.



Notes: 

We've talked about the different types of splits but we've only briefly discussed scores and the different types of scores that we receive that correspond to these splits. 
We saw in cross-validation that there were train and validation scores and what happens if they did not align with each other.

How do we diagnose the problem? 

We're going to think about 3 types of scores:

- **Training score **: The score that our model gets on the same data that it was trained on. (seen data - training data) 
- **Validation score**: The mean validation score from cross-validation).
- **Test score**: This is the score from the data that we locked away. 

---

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
X = df.drop(columns=["country"])
y = df["country"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
```

Notes: 

Let's bring back our Canadian and United States cities' data to help explain the concepts of overfitting and underfitting.
 
---

## Overfitting

```python
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
scores = cross_validate(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10, return_train_score=True)
print("Train score: " + str(round(scores["train_score"].mean(), 2)))
print("Validation score: " + str(round(scores["test_score"].mean(), 2)))
```

```out
Train score: 1.0
Validation score: 0.81
```

```{python echo=FALSE, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8,  out.width = '55%'}
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y);
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plot_classifier(X.to_numpy(), y.to_numpy(), model)
plt.title("Decision tree with no max_depth")
```

Notes: 

Using a decision tree with no specified max_depth, can help explain the phenomenon is called ***overfitting***. 

Overfitting occurs when our model is overly specified to the particular training data and often leads to bad results. 

When our model fits the training data well and therefore the training score is high, however, the model does not generalize to the validation set as well and the validation error is much higher. 

This is a sign of overfitting.

The train score is high but the validation score is much lower.

The gap between the train and the validation score is bigger.

This produces more severe results when the training data is minimal or when the model's complexity is high. 
 

---

## Underfitting 

```python
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)

scores = cross_validate(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10, return_train_score=True)
print("Train score: " + str(round(scores["train_score"].mean(), 2)))
print("Validation score: " + str(round(scores["test_score"].mean(), 2)))
```

```out
Train score: 0.83
Validation score: 0.81
```

```{python echo=FALSE, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 8,  out.width = '55%'}

model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
model.fit(X,y);
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plot_classifier(X.to_numpy(), y.to_numpy(), model)
plt.title("Decision tree with max_depth=1")
```

Notes: 

Underfitting is somewhat the opposite of overfitting in the sense that it occurs when the model is not complex enough. 

Using a decision tree with a max_depth of 1, we can explain the phenomenon.

Underfitting is when our model is too simple (`DecisionTreeClassifier` with max_depth=1 or `DummyClassifier`). 

The model doesn't capture the patterns in the training data and the training score is not that high.

The model doesn't fit the data well and hence the training score is not high as well as the validation being very low as well.
 
Both train and validation scores are low and the gap between train and validation scores is low as well.

Standard question to ask ourselves: 
***Which of these scenarios am I in?***

### How can we figure this out?

***Score_train*** and ***Score_valid***.

- If they are very far apart → more likely **overfitting**.     
    - Try decreasing model complexity.

- If they are very close together → more likely **underfitting**.  
    - Try increasing model complexity.

Notes: 

This plot explains the complex curve attempting to hit multiple plots versus a simple line that has a lower success of predicting the examples. 

The question to ask is which situation are we in? 

Looking at the scores is a very good diagnostic to answer this question. 

If the scores are very far apart then we are more likely **overfitting**.     

- In this case, the solution would be to reduce the complexity of the model.

If the scores are very close together then we are more likely **underfitting**.  

- Attempting to increase the model’s complexity could help this situation.
