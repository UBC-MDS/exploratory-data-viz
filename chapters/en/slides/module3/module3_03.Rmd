# Comparing many distributions

Notes:
We have seen have we can use facetting for histograms
and both faceting and coloring for density plots
to compare multiple distributions against each other.
So far we only studied these plots with up to three different distributions to compare,
but what if we had many more that,
such as 10, 20 or even 50?

---

## The extended movies dataset

```{python}
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

movies_extended = data.movies().dropna(subset=['Major Genre'])
movies_extended
```

Notes:
For this exercise we will use another movies dataset containing additional genres.
Here we are loading in that dataset from the vega sample repository
and dropping all the rows that have an NaN value in the column `"Major Genre"`.

The question we will try to answer is
"Which genres have the highest worldwide gross?".

---

## Many distributions can't be effectively compared with histograms

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),
    alt.Y('count()'),
    alt.Color('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
As we have seen,
histograms often effective for comparing multiple distributions,
and not at all with this many different groups.

Most genres have a really low worldwide gross,
and because our histogram is stacked
this bar dominates with around 2000 movies,
and extends the y-axis so that it is hard to see 
how many observations there are for highest
x-values
(but we know there are some since the axis extends that far).

---

## Many distributions can't be effectively compared with densities either

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_area().transform_density(
    'Worldwide Gross',
    groupby=['Major Genre'],
    as_=['Worldwide Gross', 'density'])
 .encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('density:Q'),
    alt.Color('Major Genre')))
```

Notes:
Although we saw previously that a layered density chart
is better than a stacked histogram,
it is not effective in comparing this many distributions either.

Here,
the density chart shares many of the issues with the histogram from the previous slide,
and this visualization is a poor choice for our data.

We could try faceting vertically with one distribution per plot,
but there would be a lot of subplots with this many genres
and they might not be that easy to compare when they are in subplots far apart.

So what can we do to create an effective comparison between all the genres?

---

## Bar charts are effective for comparing a single value but hides any variation

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('mean(Worldwide Gross)'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
We could use a barplot if we were only interested in comparing a single value
from each distribution,
such as the mean or median.

However,
this is generally not a good idea
because any plot that only shows a single value
will hide the variation in our data
and could lead to us drawing the wrong conclusion
as you will see in the next slide.

---

## Showing a single value can lead to incorrect conclusions

[Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128)

Notes:
This image illustrates how the same barplot (A)
could have been generated from several different distributions (B, C, or D).

If we just looked at the barplot,
we could not tell which of the distributions it came from,
but looking at the points directly
we would arrive at widely different conclusion to what was going on with our data.

In sample B,
the points seem to be slightly different between the two groups,
although there is significant overlap between the two distributions.

In sample C there seems to be one outlier data point
that increases the mean a lot for the one group,
but most of of the other points are pretty similar between the two groups.

In D, both groups have their data distributed bimodally (in two peaks).
Maybe this means that there is a third group in this data which all the high values belong too?

All the information that we just mentioned,
is lost when displaying this data as a bar chart.
Bar plots are best suited for displaying individual values,
such as counts, proportions, and sums.

This is why we most of the times need to present a richer representation of the data
such as a histogram or a density plot,
which are great as long as we don't have too many distributions to compare.

What other plots could we use instead of barplots for comparing many distributions?

---

## Showing individual observations is often more helpful than a barplot

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_tick().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
One approach would be to show the individual observations,
such as in this chart.
This is a compact plot,
which makes it easy to compare the different genres,
since they are close to each other in the chart.

We can also clearly see the reason for why the x-axis goes up to such a large max value:
There are two movies that grossed highly above the rest!

Which are these movies?

---

## Tooltips are helpful for answering questions about specific observations

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_tick().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'),
    alt.Tooltip('Title:N'))
```

Notes:
Altair really shines in answering questions like this!
In addition to having a robust visualization grammar,
Altair also provides a grammar for interactive features.

We will dive deep into more complex chart interactivity
in the last module in this course,
and by simply adding a tooltip to our chart as in this slide,
we can answer the question we posed
by hovering with the mouse over the two highly grossing movies,
try it!

(We need the `:N` because there are some title values
that makes Altair not recognize this dataframe variable as nominal otherwise)

Although this visualization is useful
in getting information about the individual movies,
it is hard to tell exactly how many data points
there are in the area that are completely blue.
Is it just enough so that we don't see any of the white background
or are there thousands of observations stacked on top of each other?

This is called plot "saturation" or "overplotting"
and we will talk more about it in the next module.
In brief,
we could use transparency to alleviate this issue to some extend,
but it is more effective to use color for representing the counts,
such as in a heatmap.

---

## Heatmaps can comparing multiple distributions without risk of overplotting

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_rect().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=100)),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'),
    alt.Color('count()')))
```

Notes:
A heatmap of the number of observations
is very simiar to a histogram,
but the count is mapped to the color 
instead of to the height on the y-axis.

This heatmap shows the "color histogram"
for each of the genres right next to each other
so that they are easy to compare and contrast.

Here we can see that some genres seem to have most of their observations
close to zero, such as Comedy and Drama
whereas others are more spread out,
such as Adventure movies.

This is a pretty effective visualization,
but since the color scale is the same for each genre
and some genres have many more observations than others,
it can be difficult to accurately interpret
the distribution of those genres that have few observations.

We wouldn't be able to distinguish
between regions with 10-20 and 40-50 observations
since the colors are so similar.

Remember that position can allow us to make more accurate interpretations than color,
so how can we use position to show multiple distributions
without using histograms?

## Boxplots show several key statistic from a distribution

<img src=/module3/boxplot-schematic.webp></img>

[What does a box plot tell you? Simply psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/boxplots.html)

Notes:
<<<<<<< HEAD
A boxplot is a mix between showing individual values
and some key summary statistics.

Instead of showing just the mean or median as with a bar plot,
a box plot shows 5 summary statistics:

The box represents three values,
the median in the middle and the upper and lower quartile at the edges
This means that means that 50% of the data points lie within the box.

The lines extending from the box as called whiskers
and the can represent a few different things.
They can be showing the min and the max (the range) of our data.

However,
it is more common that they show the furthest points that are still within
1.5 x the "interquartile" range from the edges of the box.
The interquartile range is the distance between the edges of the box

The edges of the box are called the first and third quartile,
and the median is the second quartile.
These quartiles divide the box into four "quarters",
with as many observations in each.

Conventionally,
any observations that fall outside the whiskers,
are drawn out as individual points and are sometimes referred to as "outliers",
and are occasionally discarded.

However,
what really is an outlier in your data and what you should do with them
depends on the question you are asking.
Maybe these data points are the most important in your dataset
or they could be measurement errors.
You should always look further and think carefully before discarding data as outliers.

---

## Boxplots can effectively compare multiple distributions

```{python}
bar = alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('mean(Worldwide Gross)'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
    
box = alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))

box | bar
```

Notes:
Here we show a boxplot next to the barplot we created initially.
The `|` operator works similarly to the `+` operator,
but instead of layering charts on top of each other,
it puts them next to each other.

We can see that the box plots provides us with the same clear positional comparison as in the barplot,
but we now also has access to additional information about each genres' distribution.
We can ensure ourselves that the distributions are roughly the same shape 
and check to see that where potential outliers are.

We can directly answer the question we posed at the beginning:
the Adventure genre generates the highest revenue
when comparing both the medians and the position of the boxes.

Then it seems like Action is the second most highly grossing genres,
but after that it becomes hard to compare.
We could make this visualization even more effective
by sorting the boxes according to their median value.

---

## Boxplots need to be sorted with a custom list

```{python}
genre_order = movies_extended.groupby('Major Genre')['Worldwide Gross'].median().sort_values().index.tolist()
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre', sort=genre_order))
```

Notes:
Altair does not support sorting boxplots via the "x" or "-x" shortcut.

Instead we need to create a list of the genres,
ordered by value.

We can do this with pandas by grouping the dataframe, computing the median for the grossing columns,
sorting the values, and then extracting the index as a list.

Now the visualization is very effective!
It is easy to compare genres with similar grossing
since they are right next to each other in the plot.

---

## Boxplots can be scaled by the number of observations

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre', sort=genre_order),
    alt.Size('count()'))
```

Notes:
The size of the boxes can be made proportional to the count of observations
in that group.

This helps us see if there are many more observations 
underlying some of the boxes versus others.
In our plot,
we can see that the "comedy" genre has the most movies
whereas there are few documentaries and black comedies.


If we wanted a more precise indication of the counts,
we could have have used separate barplot instead.

---

## TODO mention violinplots and striplots are often better but not available yet


Also shwo facetted histograms?

Notes:
While it is possible to make [violin plots](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/violin_plot.html)
and [stripplots](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/stripplot.html) (categorical scatter plots) in Altair,
these do currently not work with a categorical x/y axies,
and you need to use faceting instead to display different categories,
which gives us less flexibility.
Therefore,
we will primarily use boxplots when comparing multiple distributions with Altair.
