# Comparing many distributions

Notes:
We have seen have we can use facetting for histograms
and both faceting and coloring for density plots
to compare multiple distributions against each other.
So far we only studied these plots with up to three different distributions to compare,
but what if we had many more that,
such as 10, 20 or even 50?

---

## The extended movies dataset

```{python}
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

movies_extended = data.movies().dropna(subset=['Major Genre'])
movies_extended
```

Notes:
For this exercise we will use another movies dataset containing additional genres.
Here we are loading in that dataset from the vega sample repository
and dropping all the rows that have an NaN value in the column `"Major Genre"`.

The question we will try to answer is
"Which genres have the highest worldwide gross?".

---

## Many distributions can't be effectively compared with histograms

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),
    alt.Y('count()'),
    alt.Color('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
As we have seen,
histograms often effective for comparing multiple distributions,
and not at all with this many different groups.

Most genres have a really low worldwide gross,
and because our histogram is stacked
this bar dominates with around 2000 movies,
and extends the y-axis so that it is hard to see 
how many observations there are for highest
x-values
(but we know there are some since the axis extends that far).

---

## Many distributions can't be effectively compared with densities either

```{python}
(alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_area().transform_density(
    'Worldwide Gross',
    groupby=['Major Genre'],
    as_=['Worldwide Gross', 'density'])
 .encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('density:Q'),
    alt.Color('Major Genre')))
```

Notes:
Although we saw previously that a layered density chart
is better than a stacked histogram,
it is not effective in comparing this many distributions either.

Here,
the density chart shares many of the issues with the histogram from the previous slide,
and this visualization is a poor choice for our data.

We could try faceting vertically with one distribution per plot,
but there would be a lot of subplots with this many genres
and they might not be that easy to compare when they are in subplots far apart.

So what can we do to create an effective comparison between all the genres?

---

## Bar charts are effective for comparing a single value but hides any variation

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('mean(Worldwide Gross)'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
We could use a barplot if we were only interested in comparing a single value
from each distribution,
such as the mean or median.

However,
this is generally not a good idea
because any plot that only shows a single value
will hide the variation in our data
and could lead to us drawing the wrong conclusion
as you will see in the next slide.

## Showing a single value can lead to incorrect conclusions

[Beyond Bar and Line Graphs: Time for a New Data Presentation Paradigm](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128)

Notes:
This image illustrates how the same barplot (A)
could have been generated from several different distributions (B, C, D, or E).
If we just looked at the barplot,
we could not tell which of the distributions it came from,
but looking at the points directly
we would arrive at widely different conclusion to what was going on with our data.

This is why we most of the times need to present a richer representation of the data
such as a histogram or a density plot.
Since these do not work well for multiple distributions,
we will use a compromise: the boxplot.

---

## Boxplots show several key statistic from a distribution

<img src=/module3/boxplot-schematic.webp></img>

[What does a box plot tell you? Simply psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/boxplots.html)

Notes:
Instead of showing just the mean or median,
a box plot shows 5 values.
The box always represents the median and the upper and lower quartile,
which means that 50% of the data points lie within the range of the box.
The whiskers can represent a few different things,
in this picture they re the min and min and the max (the range) of our data,
but they can also be 1.5x the interquartile range
and then any observations outside this are drawn out as individual points
(this is the case in Altair).

---

## Boxplots can effectively compare multiple distrubtions

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre'))
```

Notes:
Now it is much easier to see how the distributions compare!
We can directly answer the question we posed at the beginning:
the Action genre generates the highest revenue
when comparing both the medians and the position of the boxes.

Then it seems like Adventure is the second most highly grossing genres,
but after that it becomes hard to compare.
We could make this visualization even more effective by sorting the boxes by value.

---

## Boxplots need to be sorted with a custom list

```{python}
genre_order = movies_extended.groupby('Major Genre')['Worldwide Gross'].median().sort_values().index.tolist()
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre', sort=genre_order))
```

Notes:
Altair does not support sorting boxplots via the "x" or "-x" shortcut.

Instead we need to create a list of the genres,
ordered by value.

We can do this with pandas by grouping the dataframe, computing the median for the grossing columns,
sorting the values, and then extracting the index as a list.

Now the visualization is very effective!
It is easy to compare genres with similar grossing
since they are right next to each other in the plot.

---

## Boxplots can be scaled by the number of observations

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_boxplot().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross'),
    alt.Y('Major Genre', sort=genre_order),
    alt.Size('count()'))
```

Notes:
The size of the boxes can be made proportional to the count of observations
in that group.

This helps us see if there are many more observations 
underlying some of the boxes versus others.
In our plot,
we can see that the "comedy" genre has the most movies
whereas there are few documentaries and black comedies.


If we wanted a more precise indication of the counts,
we could have have used separate barplot instead.

---

## TODO mention violinplots and striplots are often better but not available yet

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X('Worldwide Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),
    alt.Y('count()'),
    alt.Color('Major Genre')).properties(height=50).facet('Major Genre', columns=1)
```

Also shwo facetted histograms?

Notes:
While it is possible to make [violin plots](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/violin_plot.html)
and [stripplots](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/stripplot.html) (categorical scatter plots) in Altair,
these do currently not work with a categorical x/y axies,
and you need to use faceting instead to display different categories,
which gives us less flexibility.
Therefore,
we will primarily use boxplots when comparing multiple distributions with Altair.
