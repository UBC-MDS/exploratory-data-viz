# Course Learning Outcomes 

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:
- Describe supervised learning and identify what kind of tasks it is suitable for.
- Explain common machine learning concepts such as classification and regression, training and testing, overfitting, parameters and hyperparameters, and the golden rule.
- Identify when and why to apply data pre-processing techniques such as scaling and one-hot encoding.
- Describe at a high level how common machine learning algorithms work, including decision trees, and ùëò-nearest neighbours.
- Use Python and the scikit-learn package to develop an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline.
