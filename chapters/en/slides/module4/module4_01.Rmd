# Visualizing Multidimensional Distributions

Notes:
In this slide deck,
we will extend what we learned in the previous module
about visualizing individual quantitative dataframe columns
as one-dimensional distributions
to also be able to visualize two-dimensional distributions.

---

## Reading in the data

```{python}
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

movies_extended = pd.read_csv('data/movies-extended.csv')
movies_extended
```


Notes:
We're continuing to work with the movies data set.
Here we have done some additional preprocessing steps to the data
and saved it to disk beforehand
so that we can load it indirectly on this slide.

This is largely the same dataset as before,
but we filtered out some additional NaNs
and a few categories that contained problematic values.

---

## Scatter plots are effective visualizations for 2D distributions

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_point().encode(
    alt.X('IMDB Rating'),
    alt.Y('Rotten Tomatoes Rating'))
```

Notes:
In the last module, we saw how to visualize the distribution
of a single numerical dataframe column.
What if we instead want to compare the distributions
of two columns with each other?

A question we could answer with this type of comparison is
*"Are movies rated similarly on different online platforms?"*

In this slide, we are showing the movie rating from both
https://www.imdb.com/ and https://www.rottentomatoes.com.
These are both websites where people can rate movies.

There is clearly a pattern in this scatter plot,
but how can we interpret it?

The first thing that stands out
is the overall pattern of the points
which is resembles a diagonal line with some variation around it.

When the points in a scatter plot lines up in a pattern
that resembles a diagonal line as in this chart,
it means that there is a relationship
between the two dataframe columns we have visualized.

In other words,
we can clearly see that as one of the ratings goes up,
so does the other
and there are only a few exceptions to this.

The relationship in this plot would be considered strong
because we can see clearly the diagonal trend
that the points follow.

---

## Non-linear relationships follow a predictable pattern that is not a straight line

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_point().encode(
    alt.X('IMDB Rating'),
    alt.Y('IMDB Votes'))
```

Notes:
The relationship in the previous slide followed a straight line
and we would refer to it as a "linear" relationship.

However,
not all relationships are linear.
In this slide, we can see that there appears to be a clear pattern
between the rating and the number of votes a movie receives
but it follows a bent curve
rather than a straight line.

This still appears to be a pretty strong relationship,
but it is a bit hard to tell
because of the many points in a big chunk at the bottom.

When a relationship is not following a straight line,
we say that it is non-linear.
There are many types of non-linear relationships,
but we will not delve into them in this course.

---

## The stronger the relationship, the closer together the points are

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_point().encode(
    alt.X('IMDB Rating'),
    alt.Y('IMDB Rating'))
```

Notes:
If the relationship between two columns was really strong,
the points would be very close together
and there would be little variation.

In this plot, we have visualized the same column for both the X and Y axis,
which means the relationship is perfect.

We would never expect to see this strong of a relationship in real data,
but it is good to know what are extreme cases.

On that topic,
let's see what a plot looks like
when there appears to be no relationship 
between the plotted dataframe columns.

---

## When there is no relationship, there is also no pattern in the plotted points

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended.reset_index()).mark_point().encode(
    alt.X('IMDB Rating'),
    alt.Y('index'))
```

Notes:
Here,
we have plotted the IMDB Rating
against the row number in the dataframe
(remember that when you reset the index of a dataframe
a new column is created with the previous index/row number).

Unless the data had been ordered in a specific manner previously,
we would expect there to be no relationship
between these two dataframe columns
and that is exactly what we see in this plot.

There is no distinct pattern here,
just a cloud of points.
In other words,
by knowing the value on the x-axis,
there is no way we could know the value on the y-axis.

For example,
a movie with an IMDB Rating of 4-5 could have an index number
anywhere from 0 to 1200.

Let's contrast this with the first visualization we created. 

---

## A strong relationship means that the value on one axis gives information about the value on the other axis

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_point().encode(
    alt.X('IMDB Rating'),
    alt.Y('Rotten Tomatoes Rating'))
```

Notes:
Here,
knowing the IMDB Rating for a movie
is informative for knowing the Rotten Tomatoes Rating.

For example,
if we know that the IMDB Rating is 4-5,
we can be quite sure that the Rotten Tomatoes Rating
will not exceed 50,
and there are just a few exceptions to this.

However,
we must be careful not to claim
that there is a causal relationship between these two dataframe columns.
All we know is that they have a strong relationship,
we don't know the details of why.

There are formal ways of measure how strong these relationships are,
but they often come with some caveats
and it is generally more informative to look at the visualizations
to understand how the two columns are related to each other.

Remember what we learned in module 1,
people are generally better at detecting visual patterns
than interpreting individual numbers summarizing these relationships.

---

## Saturated scatter plots are difficult to interpret

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_point().encode(
    alt.X('Production Budget'),
    alt.Y('Worldwide Gross'))
```

Notes:
As we have seen,
scatter plots are generally effective for visualizing two-dimensional relationships.
However,
as with all plots,
they have their shortcomings.

Most notably,
when the bulk of the points become concentrated in a small region of the chart,
2D scatter plots become saturated in the same way
as the 1D scatter and rug plots we saw in the previous module.

In this slide we're trying to answer the question:
"Do high grossing movies tend to have a high production budget?"

In the scatter plot you can see
that it is impossible to tell
if there are more points close to 80 million or 0 on the x-axis,
and likewise, 200 million or 0 on the y-axis.

So, although we can discern a trend
for the points outside the saturated area
we do not know how the data is spread out inside the blue blob. 

To solve this issue,
we can create a two-dimensional histogram
in the form of a heatmap.

---

## A heatmap can visualize the relationship between two distributions without saturation

```{python}
alt.Chart(movies_extended).mark_rect().encode(
    alt.X('Production Budget', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=60)),
    alt.Y('Worldwide Gross', bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=60)),
    alt.Color('count()'))
```

Notes:
What's involved in creating a two-dimensional histogram?

This is similar to when we several heatmaps
to compare multiple 1D distributions,
but here we need to bin both the x and y-axis.

These bins will look like a grid or mesh
overlayed on the image,
similar to the pattern of the faint grey gridlines in the previous slide.

Within each rectangle of this grid,
we will count the number of observations
and represent the count value with a colour.

The result of these operations is the heatmap shown in this slide,
which enables us to see a level of detail we could not perceive in the scatter plot.

Here it is clear that there are many fewer movies with a production budget of 80 million
compared to the area close to 0,
and most movies seem to be around 10-15 million.
Likewise, the grossing of most movies is around 0-50 million,
not 200 million.

---

## A 2D density plot can also visualize the relationship between two distributions without saturation

<img src="/module4/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="48%" />

```{python include=FALSE}
# import seaborn as sns

# ax = sns.kdeplot(
#     data=movies_extended,
#     x='Production Budget',
#     y='Worldwide Gross',
#     fill=True, cmap='YlGn', cut=0, cbar=True)
# sns.despine()
# ax.figure.savefig('../../../../static/module4/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png')
```

Notes:
In addition to representing 2D distributions as heatmaps,
we can also represent them as density plots.

Altair cannot yet make these plots,
so here we're showing an example created 
from another plotting library called seaborn,
so that you can get a sense of what this visualization would look like for our data.

In a 2D density plot,
each bin is now two dimensional
and look like a bell in a clocktower
or the top of a circus tent,
rather than a bell-shaped one-dimensional curve.

This type of visualization gives us similar information
as the heatmap in the previous slide
and the advantages and disadvantages
are similar to those between one-dimensional histograms
and density plots.

As with 1D density plots,
the values of the density themselves are not helpful,
but we have included them here in the colour bar as an example.
