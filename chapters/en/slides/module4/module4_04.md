# Distances

Notes:

How do we calculate the similarity between examples?

One way to calculate the similarity between two points in high
dimensional space is by calculating the distance between them.

So, if the distance is higher, that means that the points are less
similar and when the distance is smaller, that means that the points are
more similar.

## Distance between vectors

**Euclidean distance**: Euclidean distance is a measure of the true
straight line distance between two points in Euclidean
space.(<a href="https://hlab.stanford.edu/brian/euclidean_distance_in.html" target="_blank">source
</a>)

The Euclidean distance between vectors

and

is defined as:

Notes:

A common way to calculate the distance between two points in high
dimensional space is by using Euclidean distance.

The formula to calculate Euclidean distance is shown.

Given two vectors or two features vectors, in our case, we are assuming
we have two feature vectors named ùë¢ and ùë£.

The Euclidean distance between them is defined by the square root of the
summation of the squared element-wise differences between these two
factors (A mouthful, we know, we will look at the steps in the next few
slides).

``` python
cities_df = pd.read_csv("data/canada_usa_cities.csv")
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(cities_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
train_df.head()
```

```out
     longitude  latitude country
160   -76.4813   44.2307  Canada
127   -81.2496   42.9837  Canada
169   -66.0580   45.2788  Canada
188   -73.2533   45.3057  Canada
187   -67.9245   47.1652  Canada
```

Notes:

Let‚Äôs return to the cities dataset that we have been working with.

As a reminder, the data set has two features: `longitude` and `latitude`
and we are trying to predict if the city is in the USA or Canada.

---

``` python
cities_viz = alt.Chart(train_df, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(size=20, opacity=0.6).encode(
    alt.X('longitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-140, -40])),
    alt.Y('latitude:Q', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[20, 60])),
    alt.Color('country:N', scale=alt.Scale(domain=['Canada', 'USA'],
                                           range=['red', 'blue']))
)
cities_viz
```

Notes:

Here is the plot showing Canadian cities in red and American cities in
blue.

---

``` python
two_cities = cities_df.sample(2, random_state=42).drop(columns=["country"])
two_cities
```

```out
     longitude  latitude
30    -66.9843   44.8607
171   -80.2632   43.1408
```

<img src="/module4/cities_distance.png" alt="A caption" width="70%" />

Notes:

Let‚Äôs take 2 points (two feature vectors) from the cities dataset.

The two sampled points are shown as black circles.

Our goal is to find how similar these two points are.

### How do we calculate the distance between the two cities?

``` python
two_cities
```

```out
     longitude  latitude
30    -66.9843   44.8607
171   -80.2632   43.1408
```

Subtract the two cities:

``` python
two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0]
```

```out
longitude   -13.2789
latitude     -1.7199
dtype: float64
```

Square the differences:

``` python
(two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2
```

```out
longitude    176.329185
latitude       2.958056
dtype: float64
```

Notes:

How do we calculate the distance between these two points (two cities)?

Let‚Äôs calculate the Euclidean distance between these two cities so here
are our two cities.

The first step is to subtract these two cities. We are subtracting the
city at index 0 from the city at index 1.

Next, we square the differences.

---

Sum them up:

``` python
((two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2).sum()
```

```out
179.28724121999983
```

And then take the square root:

``` python
np.sqrt(np.sum((two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2))
```

```out
13.389818565611703
```

Notes:

Our third step is summing up the squared differences.

Then finally we take the square root of the value.

This results in a value of 13.3898 which is the distance between the two
cities.

---

``` python
np.sqrt(np.sum((two_cities.iloc[1] - two_cities.iloc[0])**2))
```

```out
13.389818565611703
```

``` python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
```

``` python
euclidean_distances(two_cities)
```

```out
array([[ 0.        , 13.38981857],
       [13.38981857,  0.        ]])
```

Notes:

`sklearn` has a function called `euclidean_distances` that we could use
instead of going through each of the steps on the previous slide.

When we call this function on our two cities data, it outputs this
matrix with four values.

  - Our first value is the distance between city 0 and itself.
  - Our second value is the distance between city 0 and city1.
  - Our third value is the distance between city 1and city 0.
  - Our fourth value is the distance between city 1 and itself.

As we can see, the distances are symmetric. If we calculate the distance
between city 0 and city, it‚Äôs going to have the same value as if we
calculated the distance between city 1 and city 0.

This isn‚Äôt always the case if we use a different metric to calculate
distances.
