<exercise id="2" title= "Questions on Why">

**Question 1**      
Which model will still produce meaningful predictions with different scaled column values?

<choice id="1">

<opt text="Decision Trees" correct="true">

You are right! Decision Trees visit a single feature at a time, unlike ùëò-NN models, which calculate distances using the features all together. 

</opt>

<opt text= "ùëò-NN" >
 
Fantastic!

</opt>

<opt text="SVM">

This works in a similar way to ùëò-NN, where distance is calculated and features are observed together and not independently of each other. 

</opt>

</choice>

**Question 2**     
*Complete the following statement*  
Preprocessing is done ____.  

<choice id="2" >

<opt text="To the model before training">

It is done before training but not to the model. 

</opt>

<opt text="To the data before training the model" correct="true">

Great!

</opt>

<opt text="To the model after training">

It's not done to the model or after training. 

</opt>

<opt text="To the data after training the model" >

You are half right, but it's not done after training the model.

**True or False**     
_Columns will lower magnitudes compared to columns with higher magnitudes are less important when making predictions._

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="True"  >

These types of models find examples that are most similar to the text example in the *training* set. 

</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true">

Great! Just because a feature has smaller values does not mean it's less informative.

**True or False**     
*A model less sensitive to the scale of the data makes it more robust.*

<choice id="2">

**Question 1**     
`StandardScaler` is a type of what?

<opt text="Converter">

You are close but the terminology is not correct. 

</opt>

<opt text= "Categorizer" >
 
Not quite.

</opt>

<opt text="Model" >

We are not modeling with `StandardScaler` since it is *transforming* the data and not predicting on it.

Nice work!

**Question 2**     
What data does `StandardScaler` alter?

<choice id="2">

It definitely alters the training set but that's not all.

It does alter the test data but it doesn't stop there.

Not necessarily. It depends on the data we have.

We will not be able to fit our model without imputation and so it's not quite a precaution.

If we have `NaN` values in our data, should we simply drop the column missing the data?

What if it's a column that substantially helps the prediction?

</opt>

<opt text="Yes, if the majority of the values are missing from the column" correct="true">

Dropping the column may solve the issue, however, we could be losing a lot of important information.

<exercise id="8" title='Imputing in Action'>

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's take a look at a modified version of our basketball player dataset.  

First, let's take a look at if and/or where we are missing any values.

Tasks:     

- Use `.describe()` or `.info()` to find if there are any values missing from the dataset. 
- Using some of the skills we learned in the previous <a href="https://prog-learn.mds.ubc.ca/en/module8" target="_blank">course</a> find the number of rows that contains missing values and save the total number of examples with missing values in an object named `num_nan`.       
*Hint: `.any(axis=1)` may come in handy here.* 

<codeblock id="05_08a">

- Are you using `X_train.info()`?
- Are you using `X_train.isnull().any(axis=1).sum()`?

</codeblock>


Now that we've identified the columns with missing values, let's use `SimpleImputer` to replace the missing value. 

Tasks:     
- Import the necessary library.
- Using `SimpleImputer`, replace the null values in the training and testing dataset with the median value in each column.
- Save your transformed data in objects named `train_X_imp` and `test_X_imp` respectively. 
- Transform `X_train_imp` into a dataframe using the column and index labels from `X_train` and save it as `X_train_imp_df`.
- Check if `X_train_imp_df`  still has missing values.

<codeblock id="05_08b">
- Are you importing `SimpleImputer`?
- Are you using `SimpleImputer(strategy="median")`?
- Are you fitting your model?
- Are you using `transfor()` on both your train and test sets?
- Are you putting it into a dataframe with `pd.DataFrame(X_train_imp, columns = X_train.columns, index = X_train.index)`?

Now that we have a basketball dataset that no longer is missing any values, let's scale the features. 

First, let's scale using standardization. 

Tasks:     

- Import the necessary library for standardization.
- Build the transformer and name it `ss_scaler`.
- Fit and transform the data `X_train` and save the transformed feature vectors in objects named `X_train_scaled`.
- Transform `X_test` and save it in an object named `X_test_scaled`.
- Build a KNN classifier and name it `knn`.
- Fit your model on the newly scaled training data.
- Save the training score to 3 decimal places in an object named `ss_score`.

Using our trusty basketball let's impute, scale and fit a model using a pipeline to see the results. 

Tasks:

- Cross-validate on `bb_pipe` using `X_train` and `y_train` and save the results in an object named `cross_scores`.
- Transform `cross_scores` to a dataframe, take the mean of each column and save the result in an object named mean_scores.

Now that we have built a pipeline in the last interactive exercises, let's pair that with grid search to optimize our hyperparameters. 

Tasks:     

- Import the necessary grid search libraries. 
- Using the pipeline provided, create a grid of parameters to search over named `param_grid`. Search over the values 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 for the hyperparameter `n_neighbors` and 'uniform' and 'distance' for the hyperparameter `weights` (make sure to call them appropriately). 
- Use `GridSearchCV` to hyper-parameter tune using cross-validate equal to 10 folds. Make sure to specify the arguments `verbose=1` and `n_jobs=-1`. Name the object grid_search. 
- Transform `cross_scores` to a dataframe, take the mean of each column and save the result in an object named mean_scores.
- Find the best hyperparameter values and save them in an object named `best_hyperparams`. Make sure to print these results.
- Lastly, score your model on the test set and save your results in an object named `bb_test_score`.
