**True or False**       
*It's important to imclude as much information on a plot as possible.*

<opt text="True" >

Sometimes removing categories can help commmunicate better and more effectively.

Clever!

**True or False**       
*Data can convey different messages depending on how it's visualized.*

<choice id="2" >

<opt text="True"  correct="true">

It's important to be aware of this!

This can be used to visualize a single column's distribution.

**True or False**       
*All plots should have a subtitle that adds additional details*

Often it's not necessary to have a subtitle but they can be helpful in supporting the communication of the plot's insights.

**True or False**       
*Using Altair, we can split up a title or subtitle by adding `\n` to indicate a line break.*

<choice id="2" >

<opt text="True" >

This does work in other plotting tools, but in Altair we separate our title and subtitle lines but putting strings as elements in a list. Each element in the list is indicative of a new line.

**Question 1**      
When aligning your titles, which argument would you use in `.TitleParams()`?

I think your argument should be called something else.

Which title is most appropriate for the plot below?

Not quite. Maybe take a look at slide 11.

Although this is the correct name, it's not the value we assign to the `format` argument

</opt>

<opt text="<code>SI</code>">

Close but not quite here.

**Question 3**      
To display the full number in the axis tick values instead of scientific notation, we can set `format` in `.Axis()` to which of the following )?


<center>
<img src="/module5/hockey3.svg" width="50%"></img>
</center>



<choice id="3" >
<opt text="NHL hockey player nationality" >

This isn't explaining any insights from the plot.

<opt text="birth_country vs frequency in NHL" >

Referencing the column names isn't explaining any insights from the plot.

</opt>

<opt text="Majority of NHL hockey players originate from Canada" correct="true">

Nice!

</opt>

<opt text="Hockey Players in the NLH originate from all around the world" >

This is not exactly pertaining to the plot we see above. We would more likely want to title it commenting on the large number of players originating from Canada.

<exercise id="7" title="Formatting Fun!">


**Instructions:**    
Be patient when running a coding exercise for the first time, it can take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code. Run the code to see if you obtain the desired output
and submit it to validate if you were correct.**


The [penguins](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) that we seen time and time again is going to help us practice with formatting in this question.

<codeblock id="penguins">

</codeblock>


For this question let's create a stacked histogram of the values in the `culmen_depth_mm` column for different penguin species.

***([Culmen](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/articles/art.html): the upper ridge of a bird's beak)***

Tasks: 

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that the following gets accomplished:

- In a plot named `base`, use the data source `penguins_df` to make a histogram of the different quantities of penguin species in the data. 
- Map the species on the y-axis and the count on the x-axis. 
- In the base plot make sure to give a label to the x axis. Since the species is categorical, do not set a label for the y-axis.
- Display the base plot and take a look at what it's communicating.
- Create text by using `mark_text()` and save this in an object named `text`. It should have the same x and y mapping as the base plot but this time you want to make sure the count is displayed on the side of each species bar. Make sure it's centered in alignment and located at `dx=10`.
- After observing the plot create and object named `penguin_title` using `.TitleParams()`. In this method you will need to specify an insightful title, and subtitle, give the title a fontsize of 18, and set the subtitle colour to `firebrick`.
- Remove emove the grey box outlining the entire figure by setting the argument `strokeWidth` in the `.configure_view()` method. 

<codeblock id="05_07">

- Are you setting `alt.Y('species', title=None)` in the base plot?
- Are you setting `alt.X('count()', title='something')` in the base plot?
- In the text plot, are you coding `.mark_text(align='center', dx=10)`?
- In the text plot, are you specifying `alt.Text('count()'`?
- for the titles formatting are you making sure to use the arguments `subtitle`, `fontSize` and `subtitleColor`?

You've been paying attention here!

Sometimes we need to see values within a certain range to indentify any variable or relationships within the data.

Sometimes a large value can affect the scale on an axes and make it difficult to identify and relationships or trends occuring in the data.

Which of the folowing arguments will exclude data from a plot?

We can use `.Scale()` and the `domain` argument to specify the domain of the plot axes but that does not stop the data points from appearing.

This variation of the [Phillipino dataset originally from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure) shows the income and expenditure (in PHP) of residents in the Philippine.

<codeblock id="income_exp">

</codeblock>


First let's just plot the income vs education expenditure with no transformations. Let's make sure we are formatting the axes correctly and determine if we can make any conclusions regarding the relationship between the two variables.

Tasks: 

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that the following gets accomplished:

- In a plot named `income_plot`, use the data source `income_df` to make a scatterplot. 
- Map the `tot_income` on the x-axis and `education_expenditure` on the y-axis. 
- Set the opacity of the points to 0.5 and size to 10.
- Make sure to give the x and y-axis labels (with units) and the plot a title.
- The x and y-axis values should have SI-units. 

<codeblock id="05_11a">

- Are you setting `alt.X('tot_income', axis=alt.Axis(format='s'), title='Income (PHP)'))`?
- Are you setting `alt.Y('education_expenditure', axis=alt.Axis(format='s'), title='Education expenditure (PHP)')`?
- Are you using `.mark_circle()`?
- Are you setting `opacity=0.5, size=10` within `.mark_circle()`?

</codeblock>

It's difficult to draw any clear conclusion on the relationship between these two variables. It might be helpful to transform these axes. 

**Question**      
Which type of transformation do you think would be best fitting here?


<choice id="1" >
<opt text="Logarithmic" >

Are you sure? Some people may spend 0 PHP on education.

</opt>

<opt text="Symmetric Logarithmic" correct="true">

You got it! `Symlog` is best here since some people spend 0 PHP on education. 

</opt>

<opt text="Exponential"  >

Maybe it's a good idea to refer to the notes. 

</opt>

<opt text="Absolute Value">

It doesn't make sense to have negative income or expenditures in this situation. 

</opt>

</choice>


Let's transform the axes now!

Tasks: 

Fill in the blanks in the code below so that the following gets accomplished:

- In a new plot named `income_log_plot` create a new scatter plot similarly to what we did before. 
- Map the `tot_income` on the x-axis and `education_expenditure` on the y-axis. 
- Set the opacity of the points to 0.5 and size to 10.
- Make sure to give the x and y-axis labels (with units) and the plot a title.
- The x and y-axis values should have SI-units. 
- **This time, transform both the x and y-axes with the appropriate transformation we answered from the multiple choice question above.** 

<codeblock id="05_11b">

- Are you setting `alt.X('tot_income', axis=alt.Axis(format='s'), title='Income (PHP)'), scale=alt.Scale(type='symlog'))`?
- Are you setting `alt.Y('education_expenditure', axis=alt.Axis(format='s'), title='Education expenditure (PHP)', scale=alt.Scale(type='symlog'))`?
- Are you using `.mark_circle()`?
- Are you setting `opacity=0.5, size=10` within `.mark_circle()`?

</codeblock>


**Question**      
What type of relationship is there between income and education expenditure now?


<choice id="2" >
<opt text="Positive" correct="true">

There appears to be an upward slope between the datapoints. 

</opt>

<opt text="Negative" >

Are you sure here?

</opt>

<opt text="No Relationship"  >

There appears to be some sort of relationship between the variables!
