Given the following 2 feature vectors, what is the Euclidean distance between the following two feature vectors?

Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes.

In the last exercise, we classified some Pok√©mon from the Pok√©mon dataset but we were not using the model that could have been the best! Let's try hyperparameter tuning.

First, let's see which hyperparameter is the most optimal. 

Tasks:     

Fill in the code for  a `for` loop that does the following:
- iterates over the values 1-50 in increments of 5.
- Builds a  `KNeighborsClassifier` model with `n_neighbors` equal to each iteration.
- Uses `cross_validate` on the model with a `cv=10` and `return_train_score=True`.
- Appends the ùëò value to the `n_neighbors` list in the dictionary `results_dict`.
- Appends the `test_score` to the `mean_cv_score` list in the dictionary. 
- Appends the `train_score` to the `mean_train_score` list in the dictionary. 

We have given you code that wrangles this dictionary and transforms it into a state ready for plotting.

Finish off by filling in the blank to create a line graph that plots the train and validation scores for each value of k.      
(Note: we have edited the limits of the y-axis so it's easier to read)

<codeblock id="04_20a">

- Are you importing `KNeighborsClassifier`?
- Are you using ` KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=11)`?
- Are you using `model.fit(X_train, y_train.to_numpy())`?
- Are you using `cross_validate(model, X_train, y_train, cv=10, return_train_score=True)`?
- Are you using `alt.Chart(results_df).mark_line()` to create your plot?

</codeblock>


**Question 1**    
What value would you pick for the hyperparameter `n_neighbors`?

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="1" >

There are other `n_neighbors` values that have a higher cross-validation score than at this value. 

</opt>

<opt text="11" correct="true">

Great! The CV score is highest at this value.

Are you sure this is the n_neighbors with the highest cross-validation score possible?

</opt>

<opt text="31">

Are you sure this is the n_neighbors with the highest cross-validation score possible?

</choice>

Tasks:     

Now that we have found a suitable value for `n_neighbors`, let‚Äôs build a new model with this hyperparameter value. How well does your model do on the test data?

Tasks:     

- Build a model using `KNeighborsClassifier()` using the optimal `n_neighbors`. 
- Save this in an object named `model`. 
- Fit your model on the objects `X_train` and `y_train`.
- Evaluate the test score of the model using `.score()` on `X_test` and `y_test` and save the values in an object named `test_score` rounded to 4 decimal places.

Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

_**Make sure you remove the hash (`#`) symbol in the coding portions of this question.  We have commented them so that the line won't execute and you can test your code after each step.**_

Let's bring in this Pok√©mon dataset again, but this time we are not going to be predicting a Pok√©mon‚Äôs capture rate (`capture_rt`) instead of its `legendary` classification.

We did the same process of cross validation and scoring as we did before but we obtain this plot: 

<center><img src="/module4/Q23.png"  width = "90%" alt="404 image" /></center>

This model didn't end up having a clear best score when we hyperparameter tuned but in the end, we decided to use `n_neighbors=12`.

Let's build a `KNeighborsRegressor` with this hyperparameter value and see how well your model does on the test data.

Tasks:     

- Build a model using `KNeighborsRegressor()` using the optimal `n_neighbors`. 
- Save this in an object named `model`. 
- Fit your model on the objects `X_train` and `y_train`.
- Evaluate the test score of the model using `.score()` on `X_test` and `y_test` and save the values in an object named `test_score` rounded to 4 decimal places.

<codeblock id="04_23b">

- Are using `KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=11)`?
- Are you using the model named `model`?
- Are you calling `.fit(X_train, y_train)` on your model?
- Are you scoring your model using `model.score(X_test, y_test)`?
- Are you rounding to 4 decimal places?
- Are you calculating `test_score` as  `round(model.score(X_test, y_test), 4)` )

These two boundary plots were made using SVM with an RBF kernel and the other with K-Nearest Neighbours.

**Question 1**    
Which plot more likely visualizes the boundaries of the SVM model?

<opt text="Left">

Which plot has smoother boundaries?

<exercise id="26" title="SVM True or False">

**True or False**      
_In Scikit Learn‚Äôs SVC classifier, large values of gamma tend to result in higher training score but probably lower validation score._

<choice id="1" >
<opt text="True" correct="true">

Great work!

</opt>

<opt text="False"  >

As we increase gamma, since our model is becoming more complex, our training score should increase. Since the model is more specific to the training data, the test score may decrease.

</opt>

</choice>

**True or False**     
_If we increase both `gamma` and `C`, we can't be certain if the model becomes more complex our less complex._

<choice id="2" >
<opt text="True"  >

Increasing both `C` and `gamma` makes the model more complex in both cases so the model will be increasing in complexity. 

</opt>

<opt text="False" correct="true" >

Great work.

**Instructions:**    
Running a coding exercise for the first time could take a bit of time for everything to load.  Be patient, it could take a few minutes. 

**When you see `____` in a coding exercise, replace it with what you assume to be the correct code.  Run it and see if you obtain the desired output.  Submit your code to validate if you were correct.**

We've used K-Nearest Neighbours to classify Pok√©mon from the Pok√©mon dataset so now let's try to do the same thing with an RBF kernel!

Tasks:     

- Create an `SVM` model with `gamma` equal to 0.1 and `C` equal to 10 then name the model `model`.
- Train your model on `X_train` and `y_train` (Hint: you may want to use `.to_numpy()`).
- Score your model on the training set using `.score()` and save it in an object named `train_score`.
- Score your model on the test set using `.score()` and save it in an object named `test_score`.

<codeblock id="04_27">

- Are you importing `SVM`?
- Are you using ` SVM(gamma=0.1, C=10)`?
- Are you using `model.fit(X_train, y_train.to_numpy())`?
- Are you using `model.score(X_train, y_train)` to find the training score?
- Are you using `model.score(X_test, y_test)` to find the test score?
