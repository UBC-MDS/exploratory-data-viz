    In this module, students will learn to build interactive Altair visualizations with linked selections, widget controls, and lightweight sharing options.

    **NOTE** There is currently an issue with how chart interactions
    work within these slides. To make the charts behave as expected,
    click on a slide and then press the `f` key on your keyboard
    to display the slides in fullscreen mode (use `Esc` to exit fullscreen).
