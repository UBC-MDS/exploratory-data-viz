# Aggregations, lines, and layers

Notes:

In this slide deck, we will see how to aggregate data in Altair
(to plot the mean, median, etc),
how to create lineplots via `mark_line()`,
and how to combine line and point plots together
via layers.

---

## Including all the data can hinder visualization of general trends

```{python}
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Weight_in_lbs',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin')
```

Notes:
Throughout this course
we will explore many different datasets,
but for now, we will stick to the `cars`
dataset to keep it simple
and focus on introducing additional Altair functionality.

Let's refresh our memory with this plot from the previous module.

We noted that it appears that cars differ
in their weight and mileage
based on their country of origin.
At least the American cars appear to stand out,
but it is difficult to see any differences
between Europe and Japan.

Visualizing all data points as in this slide
is helpful to detect patterns in the data.

But when showing all observations,
it can be hard to pick up on general trends in the data,
e.g. if there are any differences in the mean weight
of cars made in either Japan or Europe.

To more effectively visualize such general trends in the data,
we can create plots of statistical summaries,
such as means and medians.

In Altair (and pandas) these are referred to as data aggregations.

---

## Data aggregations are built into Altair

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='mean(Weight_in_lbs)',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)',
    color='Origin')
```

Notes:
To plot the means of weight and mileage,
we could use pandas to first calculate the mean values,
and then plot the resulting dataframe in Altair.

This is powerful since we can access all aggregations built into pandas,
but it is a bit verbose for simple common operations, such as the mean.

Fortunately,
Altair has shortcuts for plotting simple aggregations
where you provide the name of the aggregation
together with the name of the column inside a string
as in the example in this slide.

<a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html#binning-and-aggregation" target="_blank">The Altair documentation includes a table
with all available aggregations</a> (scroll down a little on the linked page).

In this visualization, we can detect small differences
between the means of the Japanese and Europeans cars,
which was not discernible when we plotted all the points.

Whether this difference is big enough to reach a different conclusion
than when inspecting the previous plots
depends on our application and the purpose of the data exploration.

## Plotting aggregations to visualize trends over time

```{python}
cars
```

Notes:
Aggregations are often helpful when comparing trends over time,
especially when there are multiple groups in the data.
In the cars dataset,
there is a `Year` column,
indicating when the car was made.

Often when there is a notion of time in the data,
it is interesting to see how values in the dataframe change over time.

In this case,
we might be interested in knowing whether newer cars
are more fuel-efficient than older ones.

Presumably, they should be,
but does it differ depending on where the car was made?

Let's find out!

---

## Plotting aggregations to visualize trends over time works well

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)')
```

Notes:
To visualize the mean mileage for each year of all cars,
we want to perform the aggregation on the `Miles_per_Gallon` column
while leaving the `Year` column intact.

As you can see this plot one value (the mean)
for each year in the dataframe.

Here we can see that the observations in this dataframe span the years 1970-1982
and it does indeed look like the mileage is getting better over time
as we expected!

---

## Plotting all data to visualize trends over time is not effective

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon')
```

Notes:
As a comparison with the previous slide,
if we instead of the mean would plot all the data points for each year,
it would be much more difficult to see the pattern over time
as you can see here.

---

## Plotting points to visualize trends over time is not ideal

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)',
    color='Origin')
```

Notes:
If we try to explore the mileage over time
while grouping the cars according to their origin,
it is a bit difficult to immediately recognize
which points belong to which group.

In fact,
using points for visualizing trends is not ideal,
and lines are often preferred
as we will see in the next slide.

---

## Plotting lines to visualize trends over time is ideal

```{python}
alt.Chart(cars).mark_line().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)',
    color='Origin')
```

Notes:
One key advantage of line plots is that they connect
all the observations that belong to the same group
presenting them as one unified graphical object (one line),
which is easy for us to distinguish when looking at the plot
instead of trying to connect the dots mentally.

Another advantage is that the slope of the line
makes it easier to see if the value from one year to another
is increasing or decreasing.

Altair grammar lets us switch from a point plot to a line plot,
by only changing `mark_point()` to `mark_line()`,
and keeping the rest of the code as-is.

In this plot, we can clearly compare the mileage trends over time
to conclude that cars from all origins improved their mileage,
and that the trajectory and mileage values
are the most similar between Europe and Japan.

---

## Combining a line with a set of points via layers

```{python}
line = alt.Chart(cars).mark_line().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)')

point = alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)')

line + point
```

Notes:

To augment a line plot,
it is sometimes helpful to add `point` marks for each data point along the line,
to emphasize where the observations fall.

This is helpful since the line drawn between points could be misleading
if we have very few points.

For example,
if you see a straight line,
does that mean there are just two points,
one in each corner of the line?

Or are there ten points spread out all along the line?

To combine two different types of graphical marks
(line and point in this case),
we will use Altair's *layering* grammar.

In this slide,
we start by defining each chart separately:

first a line plot, <br>
then a point plot.

We can then use the `+` (plus) operator
to combine the two into a layered chart.

---

## Building upon previous plots can save time when combining charts

```{python}
line = alt.Chart(cars).mark_line().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)')

line + line.mark_point()
```

Notes:
We can also create a layered plot
by reusing a previous chart definition.

Rather than creating the point plot from scratch,
we can start with the line plot,
and then invoke the `mark_point` method.

We could also have typed `mark_line(point=True)`,
which is a special case for getting points on a line
since it is such a common operation,
but the layering grammar extends to other plots,
so it is more helpful to focus on learning that.

---

## Showing raw values together with the mean is often helpful

```{python}
line = alt.Chart(cars).mark_line().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)')

line + line.mark_point().encode(y='Miles_per_Gallon')
```


Notes:
When we are combing plots in layers,
we can not only change the mark,
but also the encodings.

This way,
we can create a layer with one point per observations,
and with a line for the average values.

For this, we need to use `encode` again
after creating the first plot,
to instruct Altair to use the raw values
instead of the mean for the points.

(note that the axis now has two labels,
we will see how to change that in a future lecture).

This type of visualization is helpful when we want to show
both the underlying data and a statistical summary,
which is often helpful for elucidating what the data tells us.

It is also a good check to make sure nothing unexpected is
going on with the raw values as we saw in the introductory example with Anscombe's quartet.

---

## All encodings of the base chart are propagated unless they are overwritten

```{python}
line = alt.Chart(cars).mark_line().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)',
    color='Origin')

line + line.mark_point().encode(y='Miles_per_Gallon')
```

Notes:
We have already seen that the x and y encoding remain the same
in any subsequently created plots.

Here,
we're showing that this also applies to the colour encoding
to illustrate that any encoding
will be propagated to all layers
unless they are specifically overwritten.

If we would only have added colour to the point chart,
there would still have been a single line instead of three.
