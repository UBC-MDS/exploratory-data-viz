A data visualization grammar determines how to combine individual parts of the plotting syntax to create complete visualization.\nIn the example on this slide, you can see that the three bullet points are now broken down into one main function to create the chart linked to the data, and then we build upon this by adding the graphical elements (add_points()) and the encoding of the columns to properties of this chart (encode_columns()).\nBy combining these three grammatical components in different ways, we can build a wide range of visualizations, without memorizing a unique function for each plot type.\nThanks to this grammatical visualization approach, we also only require minimal changes to our code to change the type of plot."

We can use these datasets by importing the data module from the vega_datasets packages as in this slide. Here, our data contains the name of different cars and some attributes relating to each car. There are many interesting questions we could ask from this data set! For our first plot, let’s explore the relationship between how heavy a car is (the Weight_in_lbs column) and how good gas mileage it has (theMiles_per_gallon column).\nBefore starting to code the visualization, take a few seconds and think about what you would expect the relationship between these two columns to look like when you plot it."

This is called a graphical mark in Altair, and in this slide, we have used mark_point() to show the data as points.\nSince we have not specified which columns should be used for the x and y axes, we appear to only see one point in this plot since all the data is plotted on top of each other in the same location.\nTo the right of the chart, there is a button with three dots on it. don’t worry about it right now, we will explain what this is for at the end of the chapter."

These are called axis ticks and help us see where the values of this dataframe column lie along the axis.\nThe faint gray lines are called grid lines and extend the locations of the axis ticks so that it is easy to compare their position to the points.\nThis is particularly useful when the points might be further away from the axis ticks, such as in the next slide."

When we encode a column as the colour channel Altair will automatically figure out an appropriate colour scale to use, depending on whether the data is numerical, categorical, etc. Here we have indicated that we want to colour the points according to the car’s horsepower, which indicated how powerful its engine is.\nWe can see that the heavier cars have more powerful engines, than the lighter ones, but when using colour for a numerical comparison like this, makes it is harder to tell whether the relationship follows a straight line or is of another nature, so this encoding is mostly useful as an approximate indication of the horsepower.\nWe can also observe a relationship between the horsepower of a vehicle and the fuel efficiency. It appears that cars with greater horsepower (the points with a darker shade of blue) are less efficient with their fuel since miles per Gallon is much lower.\nIn the next module, we will learn more in detail about which encodings are most suitable for different comparisons."

As in the previous slide,\nAltair automatically adds a helpful legend, and we can see that the heavier, more powerful cars are primarily manufactured in the US, while the lighter more fuel-efficient ones are manufactured in Europe and Japan (remember that this is true for this particular dataset, and not necessarily all cars)."

We will learn about the grammar of visualization and how it’s implemented in the “Altair” package to create our figures. In addition to common statistical visualizations, we will learn how to tell stories with data, create geographical visualizations, and bring out plots to life by adding interactive elements. Together, these skills will allow us to create effective data visualizations that strengthen our own exploratory data analysis skills and our ability to communicate insights to others.

Or are you creating a plot to help you understand the structure of your data more in general, such as plotting the distribution of each dataframe column?\nIn either case, it can be extremely helpful to draw out your plot with pen and paper first. This helps you think about if the plot you are creating makes sense or if there is another plot better suited for the task at hand.\nDrawing with pen and paper also makes it easier to write the code afterwards, since you clearly know what you are expecting the visualization to look like."

Can you see the differences in the general trends between these four sets of numbers? This is a slightly modified version of the original, which was put together by statistician Francis Anscombe in the 70s."

At least the American cars appear to stand out, but it is difficult to see any differences between Europe and Japan.\nVisualizing all data points as in this slide is helpful to detect patterns in the data.\nBut when showing all observations, it can be hard to pick up on general trends in the data, e.g. if there are any differences in the mean weight of cars made in either Japan or Europe.\nTo more effectively visualize such general trends in the data, we can create plots of statistical summaries, such as means and medians.\nIn Altair (and pandas) these are referred to as data aggregations."

In the cars dataset, there is a Year column, indicating when the car was made.\nOften when there is a notion of time in the data, it is interesting to see how values in the dataframe change over time.\nIn this case, we might be interested in knowing whether newer cars are more fuel-efficient than older ones.\nPresumably, they should be, but does it differ depending on where the car was made?\nLet’s find out!"
