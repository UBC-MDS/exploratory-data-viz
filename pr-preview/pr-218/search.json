However, the chart we created is not static!\nWe used alt.selection_point and alt.condition to make it interactive, so that we can click the legend to show the points from only a specific genre.

Then, instead of binding alt.selection_point to the legend we can pass the dropdown to the bind parameter.\nThe dropdown requires an array to be passed to the options parameter; here we sort the genres alphabetically before passing them to the dropdown.\nSince we recreated the select_genre variable, we need to also redefine the opacity encoding and add this new variable to overwrite the old one.\nNow you can use the dropdown to select movies of different genres!\nNote that the location of the dropdown is fixed and there is no way change its location."

For example, we might want to show only comedies that are rated as suitable for children to watch.\nWe have already seen how to perform such breakdowns via faceting, but we could also do it by combining multiple interactive widgets.\nHere we’re adding a set of radio buttons for the maturity rating of the movies and a dropdown button for the genre selection.\nFirst we create the radio buttons and the dropdown as two separate widgets. We then use both these widgets to the selection_point object, so that the dropdown is bound to the 'Major_Genre' dataframe column and the radio buttons are bound to 'MPAA_Rating.\nTo trigger a selection, we now need to both click a radio button and make a selection in the dropdown."

To instead highlight based on quantitative values, we can use a slider.\nAdding a slider is similar to adding a dropdown or set of radio buttons, and we do it via binding_range(). Here we link the slider to the same column that is mapped to the x-axis, so that you can see how it works.\nIf you drag the slider around, you can see that the default behaviour is to only highlight points that exactly match the value of the slider.\nNow that we understand how we can create a slider, let’s next see how to use it in a slightly more realistic setting, such as highlighting values above or below a threshold."

To do this we need to compare the current value of the slider with the observations’ values in the column we are filtering on.\nThe current value of the slider can be accessed via select_rating.Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating, and Altair has a special datum object to access values from different columns in the dataframe. To compare against the column with the Rotten Tomatoes Ratings, we use alt.datum.Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating.\nThis might seem cumbersome at first, but it is necessary to avoid ambiguity with only writing \"Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating\", which in comparison expressions means just the string and is not a reference to a column in the dataframe.\nNow that we drag the slider you can see that all the points are highlighted that have a value less than the slider value."

This happens to work well for the ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, but what if we wanted to use it for the IMDB ratings instead?\nSince the slider does not automatically adjust to the range of the data, we need to define the range manually. Here we set the minimum to be 1 (there is no 0 rating for IMDB), the maximum to be 10.\nWe also demonstrate how to change the step size. Now that we drag the slider handle it jumps half a step at a time, instead of the default step size of 1, which gives us increased precision in which movies we are selecting.\nJust as with dropdowns we could set an explicit start value to have an active selection when the chart first appears.\nHere we have specified the slider to be set at 4 when the chart first loads via setting value=4 in alt.selection_point."

Since the range for this is outside 0 - 100, we explicitly set the max to a higher value, and adjust the stepsize to something more meaningful.\nNow we can use the slider to filter movies on the amount they grossed. However, since we cannot select a range on the slider, we’re limited to selecting all movies either bigger than or smaller than the slider value."

The reason for this is that sliders only work with numerical data and support for temporal data is not yet implemented. in Altair.\nAs an alternative to the slider, we can use another plot to to select data, which has several other advantages as you will see in the next slide."

This is because the histogram gives us information about how many movies we have data for each year and it also lets us select a range of years.\nWe can use what we learned in the last slide deck to link the selection between the two plots. The biggest difference here is that instead of a single or multi selection, we will use the selection_interval function to create a range selection.\nIn this histogram we can see that there are just a few movies from the 1980s in the data and only one in 2040, which must be an error in the dataset.\nIn addition to showing the distribution of the data this also allows us to select a range of values, which is not possible with sliders in Altair. We can then drag the selection with the mouse, just as when we were selecting in the scatter plots in the first slide deck of this module.\nIf we wanted to we could also style the histogram chart to look more like a widget, and remove the incorrect data point, but we won’t do that here."

However, we could also use the approach with an additional chart as in the previous slide to create a so called “minimap” for navigation of another chart.\nThe key to making this interaction work is to let the interval selection control the axis extent (the domain) of the main chart, while only adding it as a selection on the “minimap” chart.\nThe syntax for this is consistent with what we have learned earlier, but instead of having a condition that checks if an observation falls within the selection, we’re directly using the range of the selection to set the domain in the main chart."

However, in some cases this might make individual points harder to see or take up more space than we have available for our visualizations.\nInstead, we could enable zooming and panning on the chart with the interactive() method. This works on all visualizations except maps and allows us to zoom in by using the scrolling feature of our mouse or touchpad, and pan by clicking and dragging the chart. Double clicking resets the zoom and pan to the default view.\nIn addition to resolving tooltip ambiguity, adding the zooming and panning feature allows your audience to decide which regions of the chart they want to look closer at, which would not be possible with a static visualization."

This is particularly helpful when highlighting the same points in multiple linked charts.\nIn a few slides, we will see a concrete example of how this can be used to answer a specific question, but first, let’s walk through the syntax for adding selections to a single chart.\nTo add a selection to a chart, we first need to create the selection object. In this slide we create and interval selection by specifying alt.selection_interval() and then giving this the name brush.\nThe reason for this name is that selecting points with an interval is often referred to as “brushing” in data visualization terminology. You would commonly see this when reading online resources on interactive selections in data visualization.\nAfter creating the selection object, we add it to our chart using add_selection(), which means that we can use our cursor in the chart to create a grey selection rectangle by clicking and dragging with our mouse or touchpad.\nYou can click to drag the selection around and to clear it you can either double click the selection or click once outside the selected region.\nBut it doesn’t look like any of the points are highlighted yet, why not?"

You can think of it like this:\nalt.condition(check-this, if-true-do-this, if-false-do-this)\nIn the chart on this slide we check if our interval range selection brush contains any data points. If that is true, we use the Origin dataframe column to colour the points, otherwise we use the value 'lightgray'.\nalt.value is a helper function for when we want to map a single value to the data points, rather than mapping the values from a column in the dataframe."

In the first we have plotted Horsepower against Miles_per_Gallon and in the second we have plotted Acceleration against Weight_in_lbs.\nWe can use this to see patterns or relationship between two variables within each chart, but we don’t know how the points are related between the two charts.\nFor example, we might wonder if the cars with really powerful engines and low mileage are the ones with low or high acceleration and weight. There is not way to tell this from just looking at these two charts.\nHowever, if we could highlight points of interest in one chart, and then see the same observations highlighted in the other chart - we would be able to answer such a question!\nAs you can see in this slide selections are automatically linked between the two charts. The reason this worked was because both these charts have one point for each observation in the data, so that we selected a point in one of the scatterplots the corresponding point for that same observation could automatically be highlighted in the other scatterplot.\nNow we can answer our question! Highlighting the observations where the cars have high engine power and low mileage shows that they are mostly heavy cars with slow acceleration. Importantly, the relationships of other observations can also be explored in the plot without us having to change anything."

However, it causes heavy distortion of the relative areas of land masses, and in particular, this distortion gets much worse closer to the poles.\nFortunately, many people are moving away from using this projection because it gives a distorted impression of what the world looks like. A commonly used alternative is the equalEarth projection. This projection focuses on correctly representing the relative areas of all landmasses.\nSome of the most noticeable differences in this projection are that Africa appears much bigger and Greenland, Antarctica as well as Russia appear notably smaller.\nAfrica is in fact 15x the area of Greenland, this is far far from how the mercator projection draws this - it draws them as roughly the same size."

This type of visualization can be thought of as a geographical heatmap and is often referred to as a “choropleth map”.\nTo introduce how we can do this - we will map the states identification number from our topoJSON file we loaded, to the corresponding geographic region for each state. Normally, we would not do this, but instead map some other data to each geographic region. We will do that in the following slides.\nThe 'id' field here comes from the sample topoJSON file. If we opened up and looked at this file, we would find that it contains a field called 'id', which is a numerical identifier for each state in alphabetical order.\nBecause we are not using a pandas dataframe, we must specify the type of data in the column. Here we are specifying it as a quantitative for demonstration purposes because the legend would become very long if we specified it as ordinal or nominal."

These issues are often discussed around the US election, where different approach are used to illustrate that the weight of each states’ vote is not tied to the geographical area of the state.\nOne effective way to convey this message is to use a map as a background and plot points on top that are scaled according to the measure of interest.\nTo achieve this in Altair, we need one pair of coordinates to plot for each state. For this we can use the columns latitude and longitude which represent the geometric centre of each state).\nWe then plot these coordinates on top of a map using the special longitude and latitude parameters and set the size of the points to be relative the population.\nFinally, we remove the square grey outline by setting the stroke to None.\nNow it is much easier to see that many of the states in Eastern USA have a population several times that of the states in the Midwest, although their area is smaller."

The reason is that for any condition, a state with more people is likely to show more cases, unless there is a strong dependence on another factor that differs between the states.\nIt would be more interesting to see how many people get asthma per capita, which means dividing the number of asthma cases with the population in each state.\nLet’s do that next!"

Look at the circles in the Eastern US, many of them are overlapping which makes the chart hard to read.\nWe make all points smaller by setting the range of the size scale, but there would still be a lot of overlap.\nIn these cases, a choropleth map would be a better choice since there won’t be any overlap."

It is also clunky when we are computing an aggregation in Altair, such as using this sum here, and we would need to recompute this in pandas.\nBecause of these inconveniences, it is often preferred to use the built-in Altair approach for highlighting by passing a conditional encoding to the color parameter of the chart as we do in this slide.\nConceptually, you can think of alt.condition like this: alt.condition(IF this is true, DO this, ELSE DO this).\nSo here we are checking if the week_day column has the value 'Wed', and if it does we use the 'coral' colour, otherwise, we use the default 'steelblue' colour.\nInstead of typing out 'Wed' each time we calculate the day with the highest sum of donations using pandas and extract it using the idxmax() method, which returns the index of the row with the max value. This way, we can reuse our code in the future even if the top donation day is no long Wednesday.\nWe need to alt.value to tell Altair that we want to use this specific colour name, rather than looking for a column in the dataframe with this name.\nalt.datum is a way to unambiguously access a column name in conditional statements and other Altair computations, so that it is not confused for just that string of letters."

A good rule of thumb is that when you get to around five different hues, you should really consider if this is the best way to represent your data or if you could split it up into multiple visualizations instead.\nIf the data is neatly organized in well-separated clusters, it is possible that you could visualize more than five colours (maybe even ten) effectively, but in data where the datapoints are more mixed, you will rarely if ever, be able to go this high."

Sorting the chart in an intuitive order has once again shown to be crucial for making our plot easier to interpret.\nIn a normalized stacked bar chart it makes sense to sort by either the first or the last coloured segment. Since not all genres have movies rated 'G', we chose to set the order based on 'R' instead.\nIf you are more interested in one genre than others, you could also choose to sort by that genre.\nNow we can directly compare the length of individual bar segments between the genres. We see that there certainly are differences in the proportions of MPAA ratings between movies in different genres.\nFor the R rating, it is immediately obvious exactly how big these differences are, and we can see that all black comedies are rated R, while almost no adventure movies receive this rating.\nIt is a little bit harder to compare the other rating because the coloured segments do not share the same baseline. We can still see that concerts and performance movies has the highest proportions of movies that are kids-friendly at 50%, while musicals, documentaries, and action movies have around 20% kids-friendly movies.\n(We specified the sort order manually in this slide, because it is rather advanced to extract this order using pandas, but we include an example in the transcript if you are interested in how this could be done:)\nsort_order = (\n    movies_extended\n    .groupby('Major Genre')['MPAA Rating']\n    .value_counts(normalize=True)\n    .xs('R', level='MPAA Rating')\n    .sort_values()\n    .index\n    .to_list())"

We saw in the last slide that it was a bit harder to compare the coloured segments that did not share a baseline versus the segments at the ends where the baseline is the same.\nThis means that normalized stacked bar charts are ideal when there are only two categories, since both segments will be easy to compare between categories.\nWe can see an example in this slide where we filtered the dataset to contain only movies rated either 'G' or 'PG'. It is easy to make a comparison for both the blue and the orange segments.\nStacked bar charts also work fine for 3-4 categories, but beyond that, they are usually ineffective. Even for 3-4 categories, it is often preferred to show the bars side-by-side instead of stacked."

Instead, we could use faceting as in this slide.\nHere, we have also removed some of the axis titles to make the figure more compact and less crowded with text. You will learn more about customizing elements such as titles in the next module.\nBy resolving the x-scale to be independent between the plots, the bar height is not relative to the max in each facet. This makes them easier to compare as proportions both within and between facets while still retaining an indication of the count on the x-axis.\nIf we wanted to compare the absolute counts between facets, we would leave the axis at its default value: “shared”.\nThis type of visualization is effective when we want to accurately compare the heights of bars within a genre. For example, to answer the question: “Which are the most common MPAA ratings for each genre?”."

It is important to remember that genres have more movies in total, so, we would expect them to show up highly in all the facets. Whether this is desired or not depends on the question we are asking, but it does make sense here."

In this heatmap the colour represents the combinatorial counts of two categorical columns, such as how many movies are both rated G and in the comedy genre.\nComparing squares vertically in this heatmap is similar to the first faceted plot we made and comparing them horizontally is similar to the faceted visualization in the last slide.\nIn other words, if we want to compare which genre is most common for a certain rating, we compare the colours column-wise in the heatmap. If we instead are interested in the most common rating assigned to a movie we compare the columns row-wise. We can quickly see that most dramas are rated PG-13 or R and most horror movies are rated R.\nSorting on colour/count puts the genres with many observations close together, similar to how we sorted on 'x' and 'y' in previous modules. We could sort the x-axis also, but since it has a natural order to it, we have decided to keep it as is here.\nThis visualization is effective for quickly communicating the main takeaways from the two questions and giving us an overview of the data, but it is harder to tell that exact count for each colour so, if that is of great importance a bar chart is more suitable."

Maybe this means that there is a third group in this data to which all the high values belong too?\nAll this valuable information about our data, is lost when visualizing it as a bar chart. Remember, bar charts are best suited for displaying individual values such as counts, proportions, and sums.\nTo arrive at more accurate conclusions we need to present a richer representation of the data such as a histogram or a density plot, which are great as long as we don’t have too many distributions to compare.\nBut which visualizations could we use to accurately represent the distributions while still remaining effective for comparing many distributions in the same plot?"

Sometimes, they are showing the min and the max (the range) of our data.\nHowever, it is more common that they show the furthest points that are still within 1.5 x the “interquartile” range from the edges of the box. The interquartile range is the distance between the edges of the box.\nConventionally, any observations that fall outside the whiskers, are drawn out as individual points and are sometimes referred to as “outliers”, which are occasionally discarded.\nHowever, what really is an outlier in your data and what you should do with them depends on the question you are asking. Maybe these data points are the most important in your dataset or they could be measurement errors. You should always look further and think carefully before discarding data as outliers.\nHow does it look when we use boxplots to answer our question?"

We can ensure ourselves that the distributions are roughly the same shape and view potential outliers.\nWe can directly answer the question we posed at the beginning: the Adventure genre generates the highest revenue both in terms of the medians and the overall position of the boxes.\nIt seems like Action is the second most highly grossing genre, but after that, it becomes hard to compare.

This is maybe not the first categorical column that you thought of, but don’t worry, we will look at additional ones later.\nAs we saw in the last module, faceting is a good way to compare multiple distributions and here we use it to create one histogram per production country.\nThis is a little bit of repetition, but we will discuss the histograms in more detail in these slides now that we have learned more about what they represent.\nYou can see that this particular dataset only contains movies made in the UK or the US. Because there are so many more movies made in the US compared to the UK, it is quite hard to tell if there are any meaningful differences between movies from the two countries.\nThe location of the two distributions on the x-axis look quite similar, but from these visualizations alone, we don’t have enough information to tell if the location, number of peaks, and the overall shape is the same between the two distributions."

This is often the most suitable choice, because it makes it clear when the total number of observations differ between the groups.\nIf we want to drill down and compare the distribution shape more closely we could define the y-axes to be independent for each facet, as we have done in this slide.\nNow we can get a better view of the UK histogram, which looks like it possibly could be slightly bimodal (it might have two peaks), whereas the US one is clearly unimodal (it has one peak).\nHowever, since we have such few British movies in our dataset, we can’t state this with much confidence; it might just be an artifact from the small sample number, of from which intervals the bins are covering.\nTo be more certain about if there are any meaningful differences between these two histograms, we would need to have a larger sample set from the UK and create multiple visualizations each with a different number of maxbins to see if that changes the histogram appearance.\nMaybe there are other categorical dataframe columns that would better explain the spread in movie length seen in the initial histogram?\nIn the next module, we will explore if there are more distinct differences in movie length based on which genre the movies belong to rather than its production country."

An exception to these guidelines is if the categorical axis has a natural order to it, such as weekdays, months, etc.\nThis makes it easier to see trends in the data, and to compare bars of similar height more accurately.\nTo sort the bars, we will use the arguments in the helper functions alt.X and alt.Y.\nAs with all arguments passed to Python functions, we can leave out the parameter names (x= and y=) if we pass the arguments in the order they are defined in the function signature.\nIn this example, we’re typing sort=‘x’ to specify that we want to sort according to the values on the y-axis.\nWhen sorting by value, it is often more visually appealing with the longest bar the closet to the axis line, as in this slide."

There isn’t really a more informative title we can substitute for here since the length of each bar simply represents the count of observations/records in each bin.\nNow it is easier to see where the life expectancy of the countries fall. We can see that most countries seem to have a life expectancy between 75 and 80 years and that only very few have one under 60.

This representation was also shown to be more effective, as 90% of the low shear stress areas were now correctly identified.\nOverall, these two tweaks more than doubled the outcome accuracy, from 40% to 90%.\nA huge increase from modification that might have seemed to be a mere matter of taste unless you knew visualization theory!\nSo, if anyone tells you that visualization of data is not as important as other components, you can tell them about this study and ask them what kind of visualization they want their doctor to look at when analyzing their arteries."

A data visualization grammar determines how to combine individual parts of the plotting syntax to create complete visualization.\nIn the example on this slide, you can see that the three bullet points are now broken down into one main function to create the chart linked to the data, and then we build upon this by adding the graphical elements (add_points()) and the encoding of the columns to properties of this chart (encode_columns()).\nBy combining these three grammatical components in different ways, we can build a wide range of visualizations, without memorizing a unique function for each plot type.\nThanks to this grammatical visualization approach, we also only require minimal changes to our code to change the type of plot."

We can use these datasets by importing the data module from the vega_datasets packages as in this slide. Here, our data contains the name of different cars and some attributes relating to each car. There are many interesting questions we could ask from this data set! For our first plot, let’s explore the relationship between how heavy a car is (the Weight_in_lbs column) and how good gas mileage it has (the Miles_per_gallon column).\nBefore starting to code the visualization, take a few seconds and think about what you would expect the relationship between these two columns to look like when you plot it."

When we encode a column as the colour channel Altair will automatically figure out an appropriate colour scale to use, depending on whether the data is numerical, categorical, etc. Here we have indicated that we want to colour the points according to the car’s horsepower, which indicated how powerful its engine is.\nWe can see that the heavier cars have more powerful engines, than the lighter ones, but when using colour for a numerical comparison like this, makes it is harder to tell whether the relationship follows a straight line or is of another nature, so this encoding is mostly useful as an approximate indication of the horsepower.\nWe can also observe a relationship between the horsepower of a vehicle and the fuel efficiency. It appears that cars with greater horsepower (the points with a darker shade of blue) are less efficient with their fuel since miles per Gallon is much lower.\nIn the next module, we will learn more in detail about which encodings are most suitable for different comparisons."

As in the previous slide, Altair automatically adds a helpful legend, and we can see that the heavier, more powerful cars are primarily manufactured in the US, while the lighter more fuel-efficient ones are manufactured in Europe and Japan (remember that this is true for this particular dataset, and not necessarily all cars)."

If you go back to the plot where we encoded weight in the colour channel, you can see that the plot is much clearer.\nLater we will learn more about how to efficiently load a visualization with an appropriate amount of information, and what the research indicates regarding which visual channels are the most efficient for communicating information visually."

Or are you creating a plot to help you understand the structure of your data more in general, such as plotting the distribution of each dataframe column?\nIn either case, it can be extremely helpful to draw out your plot with pen and paper first. This helps you think about if the plot you are creating makes sense or if there is another plot better suited for the task at hand.\nDrawing with pen and paper also makes it easier to write the code afterwards, since you clearly know what you are expecting the visualization to look like."

Can you see the differences in the general trends between these four sets of numbers? This is a slightly modified version of the original, which was put together by statistician Francis Anscombe in the 70s."

At least the American cars appear to stand out, but it is difficult to see any differences between Europe and Japan.\nVisualizing all data points as in this slide is helpful to detect patterns in the data.\nBut when showing all observations, it can be hard to pick up on general trends in the data, e.g. if there are any differences in the mean weight of cars made in either Japan or Europe.\nTo more effectively visualize such general trends in the data, we can create plots of statistical summaries, such as means and medians.\nIn Altair (and pandas) these are referred to as data aggregations."

Later in the course, we will learn about how to visualize missing values to understand if there are patterns in which values are missing, which could affect our data analysis.\nIn this and the previous slide, we can also see that our dataset is pretty big, there are almost 40,000 rows!\nThe first time working with such large datasets in Altair can be a bit confusing because Altair saves the entire dataframe as part of the visualization, when working with pandas dataframes,\nThis is great because each visualization is reproducible in itself, we don’t need to go looking for the data if we come across a plot on the web, or worry that the authors didn’t upload it.\nHowever, for large datasets this causes the visualizations files to become really big, and Altair shows a warning for any dataset larger than 5000 rows.\nWe will talk about this in detail in a later module, and see different strategies for working with large datasets."

The slides show an example of what this syntax looks like in general.\nSince we have uploaded our dataset to the course online repository, we will read the data directly from there using this URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/exploratory-data-viz/refs/heads/main/data/world-data-gapminder.csv.\nThis is powerful since we can use any data online without downloading it first and it allows us to create Altair charts without worrying that the entire dataframe will be included! Since Altair knows the location of the data online, the chart is still reproducible as long as the data is not removed from its online location.\nThe drawback of not using a dataframe, is that Altair cannot rely on pandas to infer what type of data there is in each column, so we need to help it by indicating the datatype.\nThis is what the :T and :Q after the column names do and an explanation of all the data types in Altair can be found in the next slide."

For example, someone’s height could be said to be either 170 cm, 170.12 cm, 170.1281 cm, and so on depending on how accurately we can measure them.\nDates are generally temporal, but there are instances when it makes sense to defines them as ordinal or even nominal categories, for example when having just a few dates to compare between.\nArmed with this knowledge, let’s get started visualizing our data!"

Because as living conditions improve around the world, child mortality is going down as can be seen in this visualization.\nIn countries where child mortality is high, women will often give birth to more children than they want in order to protect against losing some of their children.\nLower child mortality leads to more predictable family planning, which in turn often leads to smaller families. In the majority of countries where child mortality has been observed to decrease, the number of children per woman has followed and stabilized around two.\nIf you’re interested in knowing more about the world population predictions, you can use Gapminder’s online resources, for example this video on population growh and this one on why it will slow down."

(This must be spelt without the “U”)\nJust like with the stacked area chart, this is good when the total height of each bar is the most important, but it is not ideal when the main focus of our visualization is to compare the coloured groups against each other.\nThe reason it is difficult to compare the length of the coloured segments against each other (both within a bar and between bars), is that they don’t share the same baseline so we can’t just compare the position of the top part of the bars, but have to try to estimate their lengths.\nFor these reasons, it is difficult to tell the difference between the regions in this plot and it is not an effective visualization."

This visualization reveals that there is lower child mortality, fewer children per woman, and higher-income seem to be correlated.\nHowever, we would not want to draw any conclusions before performing formal statistical tests, and investigating the literature to understand if these relationships are also causative.\nIf there were so many categories that the colours become hard to tell apart, it would be worthwhile to try to facet by that dataframe column instead of encoding it as colour."

We will talk more about direct labelling versus legends in a future module, but in general, direct labelling is often clearer.\nWe could combine this strategy by using row and column in facet, which would allow us to create visualizations that split data across three different channels: rows, columns, and colour.\nWhen visualizing so many dataframe columns, it is often useful to use colour for the most important comparison, since these groups will be the closest to each other making them easier to compare.\nIt is not always that simple and in general, you should be careful to avoid creating plots that are so complex that they are hard to interpret."

This removes noise or spikes in the plotted area, which could arise when using a square bin.\nThese spikes are often not informative for us when trying to get an idea of what the distribution looks like, and a smoother area is more conducive to conveying the overall shape of the data distribution.\nThe bell-shaped bins (also called kernels) are then added together as in the animation in this slide so that they sum up to an overall distribution line. Formally, this is called a “Kernel Density Estimate” (KDE), or just a “density plot”."

Place the bell-shaped bins and add them together as in the animation a few slides ago. 2. Plot a line or area mark for the newly calculated sum of bins. In Altair, these operations are done in two explicit steps, using transform_density for the calculation.\nFirst, we specify which dataframe column we want to use for the calculation. Then we use the as_ parameter to name the newly calculated values, which we here refer to as 'density'.\nSince the 'density' values are not part of the pandas dataframe, Altair cannot ask pandas which data type it is. Therefore, we need to add ':Q' to indicate that the density has quantitative values, just as when we specified the data types in module 2.\nWe could also have calculated the sum of the bell-shaped bins as a separate step outside Altair and added it as a new column in our pandas dataframe, but it is more convenient to do both the steps in Altair.\nWe can see that this plot looks similar to the histogram we created in the last slide deck, and we would reach similar conclusions when studying it. Most movies peak around 100 min, but there is great variation all the way from ~25 to ~215 min.\nIn contrast to a histogram, the y-axis of a density plot is not very informative.\nThe definition of a density entails that the area under the curve should sum up to 1, which represents all the observations.\nTherefore the y-axis is simply adjusted based on the values on the x-axis, so that the area equals 1.\nInstead of looking at the y-axis, focus on the shape of the area and the x-axis, those are the more informative in a density plot."

We also need to indicate that we don’t want the densities to be stacked on top of each other by setting stack to False in the Y-channel encoding.\nThis plot effectively conveys the differences between runtimes of movies from different genres.\nNotably, we can see that the peaks are different locations on the x-axis for the three genres. This indicates that the most common movie lengths are different between genres.\nThis difference appears to be around 20 min, but it does not necessarily tell us where the mean and median would fall, since that also depends on where the rest of the values are distributed.\nWe can see that the Animation genre has the highest peak, which means that the values are the most densely packed around the peak in this distribution compared to the others. But we can only see the range of the History distribution, since this is plotted on top of the others.\nLet’s make the areas less opaque so that we can see the range of all the distributions."

The continuous solid shape for each group is easier to follow even when it is semi-transparent and overlaps with the other areas.\nThe transparency gives us the advantage of knowing that there is not small density area completely hiding behind a bigger one and we can also see the range of all the distributions.\nFor example, we can tell that there are some Fantasy movies that are almost as long as the longest History movies, whereas there is not a single Animation movie that is longer than 120 minutes.\nHowever, if we had more distributions to compare, a semi-transparent density plot would become hard to decipher. In such cases, we could either filter the data to plot fewer distributions or facet them vertically as we saw with the histograms previously."

This happens because the default behaviour in Altair is to end the density where the data ends, which often creates sharp borders for low numbers of observations.\nMany other plotting packages instead, extend the density beyond the observations in the dataset to make it appear smoother and it is therefore paramount to always ask how many observations there are before interpreting a density plot."

Strategies to do this include looking at the number of rows in the dataframe, creating a separate histogram, or layering the density plot together with a plot of the individual data points.\nHere we are using mark_tick to plot every single observation along the x-axis and making the density area transparent so that we can see the tick marks. By default, the ticks would be in the middle of the plot, so we are using yOffset to align them with the x-axis.\nWith as few as 10 observations, we actually don’t need the density at all and could instead just have shown the individual observations or created a histogram."

These are both websites where people can rate movies.\nThere is clearly a pattern in this scatter plot, but how can we interpret it?\nThe first thing that stands out is the overall pattern of the points which is resembles a diagonal line with some variation around it.\nWhen the points in a scatter plot lines up in a pattern that resembles a diagonal line as in this chart, it means that there is a relationship between the two dataframe columns we have visualized.\nIn other words, we can clearly see that as one of the ratings goes up, so does the other and there are only a few exceptions to this.\nThe relationship in this plot would be considered strong because we can see clearly the diagonal trend that the points follow."

There are many types of non-linear relationships, but we will not delve into them in this course."

In other words, by knowing the value on the x-axis, there is no way we could know the value on the y-axis.\nFor example, a movie with an IMDB Rating of 4-5 could have an index number anywhere from 0 to 1200.\nLet’s contrast this with the first visualization we created."

All we know is that they have a strong relationship, we don’t know the details of why.\nThere are formal ways of measure how strong these relationships are, but they often come with some caveats and it is generally more informative to look at the visualizations to understand how the two columns are related to each other.\nRemember what we learned in module 1, people are generally better at detecting visual patterns than interpreting individual numbers summarizing these relationships."

However, as with all plots, they have their shortcomings.\nMost notably, when the bulk of the points become concentrated in a small region of the chart, 2D scatter plots become saturated in the same way as the 1D scatter and rug plots we saw in the previous module.\nIn this slide we’re trying to answer the question: “Do high grossing movies tend to have a high production budget?”\nIn the scatter plot you can see that it is impossible to tell if there are more points close to 80 million or 0 on the x-axis, and likewise, 200 million or 0 on the y-axis.\nSo, although we can discern a trend for the points outside the saturated area we do not know how the data is spread out inside the blue blob.\nTo solve this issue, we can create a two-dimensional histogram in the form of a heatmap."

The columns with categorical data are referred to as “objects” and the numerical columns are read in as decimal numbers or “floats”.\nAlthough it seems unnecessary in this case, it is good practice to perform this check since there are rare cases where pandas might interpret a column differently from what we think.\nA common example of this is when people use a text string to encode missing values, for example “missing”, “null”, or “nan” instead of leaving the value blank which is best practice. This can make pandas treat a column as an object, which we might not detect when printing only the first few rows of the dataframe.\nThis can also happen with dates, which might be parsed as numbers unless you specify parse_dates=['column_name'] to read_csv.\nSpeaking of missing values, this is the next thing to check for. Columns that are missing some values might need to be imputed or dropped for machine learning tasks, and when we perform statistical tests, we need to know how many observations we have with data.\nImportantly, patterns in missing values can also give hints to which columns have strong relationships between their values and indicate if that something went wrong in the data collection process, which we should investigate before performing our analysis.\nHere, it looks like there are some NaNs in many of the columns, and the IMDB ratings and votes seems to have the most: about 60 rows are missing a value.\nThe IMDB rating and the number of votes have the exact same amount of missing values, and it makes sense that movies without votes can’t have a rating. But if we didn’t know how these columns were related, how could we check?"

We worry less about the details such as axis labels and titles, since we are trying to understand the data ourselves through an interactive explorative process, rather than making the figures look appealing in a presentation (we will see how to do that later).\nTo create these overview visualizations, it is helpful to make the same type of plot for several dataframe columns and lay them out as subplots within a figure.\nPreviously, we have made subplots via faceting, which uses a categorical column to filter subsets of the data in each subplot, and all subplots have the same columns mapped to the X and Y axes.\nHere, we will see how we can create figures where the X and Y axes are different between subplots, and all the data is present in each one of them.\nTo achieve this in Altair, we say that we repeat the same Chart setup for multiple columns.\nInstead of typing each chart out manually, we specify which columns we want to use via the .repeat method of a Chart object, and indicate with alt.repeat() where these repeated columns should be used.\nSince we are not using the dataframe column directly, we also need to specify which type the repeated columns are.\nA great first step is to visualize the distribution of each of the quantitative dataframe columns to get an overview of how our data looks and examine it to see if there are any weird things going on (e.g. values that are way too small or large, values all bunched up in one place that could indicate measurement errors, etc). To do this, we here create a histogram chart and repeat it for each of the numerical columns.\nThis overview tells us that most movies have a runtime of around 90-130 min, but there are some that are shorter and some that are longer.\nMost movies have less than 80,000 votes, but there are some that have a really high number.\nThe distribution for the IMDB ratings is centred around 6, with few extreme values on either end and no notable shift in either direction.\nOur EDA is already helping us finding interesting aspects of the data!"

This type of visualization will help us understand which columns are related to each other.\nFor example, we already saw earlier in this module that the ratings on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes have a strong relationship when we create a scatter plot of these two dataframe columns. Here, we can ask that same question of all columns in the dataset.\nThis is helpful both for our general knowledge about the data and if we have a specific goal in mind, maybe we would want to predict the movie ratings, but we are not sure which other dataframe columns would be useful to have in the prediction model?\nInstead of looking at just one relationship at a time, we visualize all of them to be able to answer the same question for all pairs of columns.\nTo create this visualization, we need to use alt.repeat on both the axes, instead of just one as for the histograms.\nIn the last slide, we used alt.repeat without arguments, which means that we are repeating over all the columns. Here we specifically set the rows and columns attributes to ensure that our repeated chart will include all the pairwise combinations of the dataframe columns.\nIn the resulting visualization, the diagonal compares the column against itself, so this is not very interesting. The same pairwise comparisons are also repeated above and below the diagonal, so we will focus our attention only on the six plots below the diagonal.\nThis type of visualization is often referred to as a scatterplot matrix or pairplot.\nUnfortunately, these plots are saturated, so although we can see that there might be some correlative relationships, we should remake this plot as a 2D histogram heatmap, using the techniques we learned in the previous slide deck."

Otherwise the high counts in the few bins of diagonals would drown out the counts in the other plots which would have the same colour almost everywhere."

It seems like Musicals, and Dramas have the longest run times. Whereas for Ratings, PG-13 and R-rated movies appear to run the longest.\nAs we have discussed before, it is often easier to compare plots where the values are sorted.\nFor a single boxplot, we learned previously that we can pass a list of the categories in the order we want to plot them.\nIn this case, we have different columns on the y-axis, so we would need to pass a list of all categories in all these three columns. We could use a loop with pandas to create this like so:\nrunning_time_order = []\nfor groupby_col in ['Major Genre', 'MPAA Rating']:\n    running_time_order.extend(\n        movies_extended\n        .groupby(groupby_col)\n        .median()\n        ['Running Time min']\n        .sort_values()\n        .index\n        .to_list())"

It also works the same way with alt.Color and alt.Size, which changes the display of these in the legend.\nAfter zooming in on the y-axis as in this slide, we can more clearly see the variation in the lower value data points. We can see that more money is often donated at the beginning of each month, except for the month of July."

As you can see this is not at all well suited to represent numerical data as the sharp transitions between hues makes it appear as if there are groups in the data, whereas we know that these values are changing gradually from left to right on the x-axis.\nIn the plot to the right, we have used the default sequential colour scheme for quantitative data in Altair. This conveys the gradual change in the Horsepower values in a perceptually uniform manner. We can clearly see that colour is changing gradually from light to dark along the x-axis, although it can be hard to pinpoint exactly which number a particular colour is (remember that colour is not as good as position to convey an exact value even when it is easy to see the overall trend)."

We can see the effect of this by studying the values in the 60-80 range in both plots. It is hard to see the differences between these in the leftmost plot, but thanks to the hue transition from yellow to green in the rightmost plot we can more clearly perceive detail in this range.\nAlthough the hue shifts in these plots are more gradual than in the plot with the categorical colour scheme in the previous slide, it may still introduce a slight bias towards seeing groupings where there are none, which is something to keep in mind.\nIn practice, both of these colour schemes are used often to represent quantitative data."

In addition to the colour schemes linked in the previous slide deck, more details and examples are available in the matplotlib documentation, and many of the core design principles are outlined in this entertaining talk, including the design choice behind Viridis.\nNote that we are using filled circular marks and the size parameter to enlarge the points slightly and make it easier to see the changes in colour that we will be discussing in this slide deck."

Guidelines for making your visualizations more accessible to those with reduced colour vision, will in many cases also improve the interpretability of your graphs for people who have standard colour vision.\nFortunately, many of these are followed by the default settings in Altair, and we don’t need to change the colour scheme for this reason.\nIf you are unsure how your plot will look for someone who sees colours differently than you, this website lets you upload an image and simulate different colour vision deficiencies."

While both the previous colour schemes were gradually increasing in lightness, this is not the case for this rainbow map.\nHere the lightest colours are in the middle and the darkest at both extremes of the colour schemes. This is particularly negative for people with colour vision deficiencies, which can no longer rely on the gradual lightness change and the varying hues, therefore, makes this plot less accessible.\nIn addition to losing the overall intuitiveness of the colour scheme, the many hues mean that we’re likely to perceive changes in the colour in a non-uniform manner, and see groups where they are none.\nImportantly, the rainbow map we have used here is a modern colour scheme called “turbo”, which was recently developed by Google. Most rainbow colour schemes you will see on plots in the wild use a colour scheme called “jet”, which used to be the default in many plotting packages but is not a good choice for any data, because it introduces artificial banding and highlighting of values.\nThe take-home message here is that there are valid use cases for modern rainbow maps, but you should be confident that there is no better alternative before reaching for this tool, and be careful when interpreting rainbow-coloured plots in general.\nThe jet rainbow colourmap should be avoided for many reasons, including that the sharp transitions between colours introduce a visual threshold that do not represent the underlying continuous data. Another issue is luminance (brightness). For example, your eye is drawn to the yellow and cyan regions, because the luminance is higher. This can have the unfortunate effect of highlighting features in your data that don’t exist, misleading your viewers! Since higher values are not always lighter, this means that your graph is not going to translate well to greyscale. More details about jet can be found in this blog post and this series of posts. A better alternative when you really need small differences in your data to stand out is to use the turbo rainbow colour scheme."

These the two countries account for roughly half of the commodity-driven deforestation around the world.\nNotably, this chart only shows deforestation that is driven by commodities, such as the need for new pastures for cattle or fields to grow crops, but this accounts for most of the tropical deforestation.\nIt would be easy to jump to conclusions upon seeing a chart like this and only blame the countries with high local deforestation rates, but it that really fair?\nHow much of this deforestation is really driven by local needs?

Much of the deforestation appears to be localized to just a few countries, yet it is driven by global demands for forest products.\nThis could be the end of our story if the main narrative we want to communicate is that deforestation is truly a global problem that needs to be solved through international collaborations.\nHowever, our story seems to leave some questions unanswered that our audience will likely be asking, such as which are the commodities that drive most of the deforestation?

Small scale clearings results in land used for combination of purposes such as residencies, orchards, croplands, and pastures.\nImportantly, our data does not contain information about how much of each commodity is due to demand outside Brazil, so we should refrain from drawing conclusions about this. However, export data for each commodity would be useful data to collect next if we were aiming to explore our story in this direction.\nAlthough beef is the major contributor to rain forest deforestation, it could be the case that our demand for more food has simply increased and cattle herds are an effective use of land to create food for human consumption.

In telling this story, it would be important to also include these uncertainties and potential challenges.\nLet’s continue our story by looking at the same breakdown for Indonesia, is beef production the biggest issue there as well?"

For example, if we wanted to replace it with olive oil, we would need almost 10x the land to do so!\nSo does it make sense for Indonesia to keep clearing forests and creating more palm plantations because they are the most efficient oil crop?\nNo, our conclusions cannot stop here. Things are not so simple. The type of land where the oil crop grows also matters.\nReplacing tropical forests containing rich biodiversity with palm oil plantations has a more severe, negative impact on the environment compared to changing the type of oil crops being grown on land that has already been deforested and used for agriculture elsewhere in the world.\nTherefore it is important that palm oil plantations are grown in a sustainable way that is compatible with preserving the tropical forests in Indonesia.\nJust as with Brazil and it’s use of pasture from deforested land to raise cattle for beef, the story of palm oil is more complex then we can illustrate in a single visualization."

Since the individual observations do not exist in the bar chart it is impossible to automatically link the two charts together.\nIt could be very useful to create a linked selection between these charts, so that when we select a region of origin in the bar chart the points in the scatter plot that are from the same origin would be highlighted.\nThis way we could study observations from each Origin separately, so how can we perform this linkage in Altair?"

Create a new selection that specifies which columns should be used for selections (the fields parameter). 2. Add this new selection to the bar plot 3. Add an encoding to the scatterplot that depends on the new click selections. Here we use opacity. Now that we click the bars the opacity of the corresponding points changes as we would expect!\nNote that we can still click and drag in the scatterplot since our brush selection is unchanged from before.\nThe same principles that we showed here can be applied to create a linked selection from the scatterplot to the barchart, which we will see an example of in a few slides."

Another useful type of interactivity is to actually filter the data based on a selection, rather than just styling the chart appearance.\nFor example, we may use a brush selection on a scatter plot to highlight particular observations, and then wonder how many observations are in our brushed selection for each region? To answer this question, we can change the bar chart to update dynamically as we select points in the scatterplot!\nTransform filters can filter data similarly to what we might do in pandas and are often referred to as “dynamic queries”. Note that but this type of filtering is best used in this kind of interactive setting, as it is not as powerful as the filtering available to you via pandas.\nSince we have conditions in the charts’ encodings that depend on the legend_click selection variable, we need to also add this selection to the charts to avoid an error, even if it is not the focus of what we are learning in this slide.\nNow that we have select points by dragging in the scatter plot we can see that the barchart updates the count to reflect the number of points we have selected of each color, neat!"

As we hover over a state in the map, the outline changes to white for the points whose states are not selected in the map.\nUsing the map to identify states can be more helpful than just adding a tooltip to the scatterplot since we might already have an intuition for where different states are located on the map and don’t have to go through each of the point’s tooltip looking for the state name of interest."

We don’t need to change the encoded dataframe columns since the opacity is already set to change when we use the hover object, regardless of whether it is used on the map or on the scatter plot.\nAs you can see, Altair’s grammar remains consistent between different types of plots, such as scatterplots, maps, and barcharts. This allows us to build on the same principles we learned earlier and expand our grammar of interactivity no matter which plots we work with."

After all, plots are images aren’t they?\nTo understand this, let’s look into how Altair visualizations are constructed.\nIn the beginning we mentioned that Altair uses the JavaScript library Vega-Lite to generate its visualizations. This is great because we get access to many interactive features that build on web technologies such as JavaScript and HTML, and our visualizations can easily be incorporated in online contexts.\nThis also means that what Altair does under the hood is not to generate an image of the visualization, but the Vega-Lite code required to construct the chart.\nThis is similar to how graphical elements work on webpages. All the buttons, banners, etc that you see when you go to a web page are not images but HTML code that your browser can convert into a graphical elements such as buttons.\nVega-Lite code is rendered in a similar way. Modern browsers know how to draw graphical elements from the Vega-Lite code, so we never need to create any images.\nSo what does this Vega-Lite code look like?"

Instead, there are rules for which words are allows to appear in the JSON file for it to be valid Vega-Lite code, which is referred to as the “specification” (or “spec” for short).\nYou can see an example of how this looks for an Altair visualization by using the to_json method as we have done in this slide.\nYou can see that the words are the same we use in Altair, but the format of the JSON specification is a bit more verbose than the Altair syntax.\nYou can paste this JSON directly into Vega-Lite online editor and you will see that it renders correctly. We included a link for this in the slide that you can try.\nYou can also click the three dot action button and select the “Open in Vega Editor” entry to achieve the same result, try it out!"
