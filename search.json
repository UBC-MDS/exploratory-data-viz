The columns with categorical data are referred to as “objects” and the numerical columns are read in as decimal numbers or “floats”.\nAlthough it seems unnecessary in this case, it is good practice to perform this check since there are rare cases where pandas might interpret a column differently from what we think.\nA common example of this is when people use a text string to encode missing values, for example “missing”, “null”, or “nan” instead of leaving the value blank which is best practice. This can make pandas treat a column as an object, which we might not detect when printing only the first few rows of the dataframe.\nThis can also happen with dates, which might be parsed as numbers unless you specify parse_dates=['column_name'] to read_csv.\nSpeaking of missing values, this is the next thing to check for. Columns that are missing some values might need to be imputed or dropped for machine learning tasks, and when we perform statistical tests, we need to know how many observations we have with data.\nImportantly, patterns in missing values can also give hints to which columns have strong relationships between their values and indicate if that something went wrong in the data collection process, which we should investigate before performing our analysis.\nHere, it looks like there are some NaNs in many of the columns, and the IMDB ratings and votes seems to have the most: about 60 rows are missing a value.\nThe IMDB rating and the number of votes have the exact same amount of missing values, and it makes sense that movies without votes can’t have a rating. But if we didn’t know how these columns were related, how could we check?"

We worry less about the details such as axis labels and titles, since we are trying to understand the data ourselves through an interactive explorative process, rather than making the figures look appealing in a presentation (we will see how to do that later).\nTo create these overview visualizations, it is helpful to make the same type of plot for several dataframe columns and lay them out as subplots within a figure.\nPreviously, we have made subplots via faceting, which uses a categorical column to filter subsets of the data in each subplot, and all subplots have the same columns mapped to the X and Y axes.\nHere, we will see how we can create figures where the X and Y axes are different between subplots, and all the data is present in each one of them.\nTo achieve this in Altair, we say that we repeat the same Chart setup for multiple columns.\nInstead of typing each chart out manually, we specify which columns we want to use via the .repeat method of a Chart object, and indicate with alt.repeat() where these repeated columns should be used.\nSince we are not using the dataframe column directly, we also need to specify which type the repeated columns are.\nA great first step is to visualize the distribution of each of the quantitative dataframe columns to get an overview of how our data looks and examine it to see if there are any weird things going on (e.g. values that are way too small or large, values all bunched up in one place that could indicate measurement errors, etc). To do this, we here create a histogram chart and repeat it for each of the numerical columns.\nThis overview tells us that most movies have a runtime of around 90-130 min, but there are some that are shorter and some that are longer.\nMost movies have less than 80,000 votes, but there are some that have a really high number.\nThe distribution for the IMDB ratings is centred around 6, with few extreme values on either end and no notable shift in either direction.\nOur EDA is already helping us finding interesting aspects of the data!"

This type of visualization will help us understand which columns are related to each other.\nFor example, we already saw earlier in this module that the ratings on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes have a strong relationship when we create a scatter plot of these two dataframe columns. Here, we can ask that same question of all columns in the dataset.\nThis is helpful both for our general knowledge about the data and if we have a specific goal in mind, maybe we would want to predict the movie ratings, but we are not sure which other dataframe columns would be useful to have in the prediction model?\nInstead of looking at just one relationship at a time, we visualize all of them to be able to answer the same question for all pairs of columns.\nTo create this visualization, we need to use alt.repeat on both the axes, instead of just one as for the histograms.\nIn the last slide, we used alt.repeat without arguments, which means that we are repeating over all the columns. Here we specifically set the rows and columns attributes to ensure that our repeated chart will include all the pairwise combinations of the dataframe columns.\nIn the resulting visualization, the diagonal compares the column against itself, so this is not very interesting. The same pairwise comparisons are also repeated above and below the diagonal, so we will focus our attention only on the six plots below the diagonal.\nThis type of visualization is often referred to as a scatterplot matrix or pairplot.\nUnfortunately, these plots are saturated, so although we can see that there might be some correlative relationships, we should remake this plot as a 2D histogram heatmap, using the techniques we learned in the previous slide deck."

Otherwise the high counts in the few bins of diagonals would drown out the counts in the other plots which would have the same colour almost everywhere."

It seems like Musicals, and Dramas have the longest run times. Whereas for Ratings, PG-13 and R-rated movies appear to run the longest.\nAs we have discussed before, it is often easier to compare plots where the values are sorted.\nFor a single boxplot, we learned previously that we can pass a list of the categories in the order we want to plot them.\nIn this case, we have different columns on the y-axis, so we would need to pass a list of all categories in all these three columns. We could use a loop with pandas to create this like so:\nrunning_time_order = []\nfor groupby_col in ['Major Genre', 'MPAA Rating']:\n    running_time_order.extend(\n        movies_extended\n        .groupby(groupby_col)\n        .median()\n        ['Running Time min']\n        .sort_values()\n        .index\n        .to_list())"

These are both websites where people can rate movies.\nThere is clearly a pattern in this scatter plot, but how can we interpret it?\nThe first thing that stands out is the overall pattern of the points which is resembles a diagonal line with some variation around it.\nWhen the points in a scatter plot lines up in a pattern that resembles a diagonal line as in this chart, it means that there is a relationship between the two dataframe columns we have visualized.\nIn other words, we can clearly see that as one of the ratings goes up, so does the other and there are only a few exceptions to this.\nThe relationship in this plot would be considered strong because we can see clearly the diagonal trend that the points follow."

All we know is that they have a strong relationship, we don’t know the details of why.\nThere are formal ways of measure how strong these relationships are, but they often come with some caveats and it is generally more informative to look at the visualizations to understand how the two columns are related to each other.\nRemember what we learned in module 1, people are generally better at detecting visual patterns than interpreting individual numbers summarizing these relationships."

This removes noise or spikes in the plotted area, which could arise when using a square bin.\nThese spikes are often not informative for us when trying to get an idea of what the distribution looks like, and a smoother area is more conducive to conveying the overall shape of the data distribution.\nThe bell-shaped bins (also called kernels) are then added together as in the animation in this slide so that they sum up to an overall distribution line. Formally, this is called a “Kernel Density Estimate” (KDE), or just a “density plot”."

Place the bell-shaped bins and add them together as in the animation a few slides ago. 2. Plot a line or area mark for the newly calculated sum of bins. In Altair, these operations are done in two explicit steps, using transform_density for the calculation.\nFirst, we specify which dataframe column we want to use for the calculation. Then we use the as_ parameter to name the newly calculated values, which we here refer to as 'density'.\nSince the 'density' values are not part of the pandas dataframe, Altair cannot ask pandas which data type it is. Therefore, we need to add ':Q' to indicate that the density has quantitative values, just as when we specified the data types in module 2.\nWe could also have calculated the sum of the bell-shaped bins as a separate step outside Altair and added it as a new column in our pandas dataframe, but it is more convenient to do both the steps in Altair.\nWe can see that this plot looks similar to the histogram we created in the last slide deck, and we would reach similar conclusions when studying it. Most movies peak around 100 min, but there is great variation all the way from ~25 to ~215 min.\nIn contrast to a histogram, the y-axis of a density plot is not very informative.\nThe definition of a density entails that the area under the curve should sum up to 1, which represents all the observations.\nTherefore the y-axis is simply adjusted based on the values on the x-axis, so that the area equals 1.\nInstead of looking at the y-axis, focus on the shape of the area and the x-axis, those are the more informative in a density plot."

We also need to indicate that we don’t want the densities to be stacked on top of each other by setting stack to False in the Y-channel encoding.\nThis plot effectively conveys the differences between runtimes of movies from different genres.\nNotably, we can see that the peaks are different locations on the x-axis for the three genres. This indicates that the most common movie lengths are different between genres.\nThis difference appears to be around 20 min, but it does not necessarily tell us where the mean and median would fall, since that also depends on where the rest of the values are distributed.\nWe can see that the Animation genre has the highest peak, which means that the values are the most densely packed around the peak in this distribution compared to the others. But we can only see the range of the History distribution, since this is plotted on top of the others.\nLet’s make the areas less opaque so that we can see the range of all the distributions."

This happens because the default behaviour in Altair is to end the density where the data ends, which often creates sharp borders for low numbers of observations.\nMany other plotting packages instead, extend the density beyond the observations in the dataset to make it appear smoother and it is therefore paramount to always ask how many observations there are before interpreting a density plot."

Notice we are now using the helper functions we saw before but now with alt.Color. (This must be spelt without the “U”)\nJust like with the stacked area chart, this is good when the total height of each bar is the most important, but it is not ideal when the main focus of our visualization is to compare the coloured groups against each other.\nThe reason it is difficult to compare the length of the coloured segments against each other (both within a bar and between bars), is that they don’t share the same baseline so we can’t just compare the position of the top part of the bars, but have to try to estimate their lengths.\nFor these reasons, it is difficult to tell the difference between the regions in this plot and it is not an effective visualization."

To be able to see all groups, we need to add some opacity to the bar mark.\nAlthough the bars share the same baseline here, they are still difficult to compare against each other, because there is so much overlap with different colours.\nLayered histograms and bar charts can be effective when there are few groups and clear separation between them, but that is not the case here and this plot is even harder to interpret than the previous one."

To ensure that the entire grid of facets fit on the slide, we’re also shrinking the dimensions of each subplot.\nFrom this chart, we can more easily compare the regions. For example, we can see that that most European countries have a higher life expectancy than most African countries.\nHowever, it is a little bit more demanding to see exactly how much of the two distributions are overlapping and we would need to look at the number of the axes while scanning left and right on the grid."

This visualization reveals that there is lower child mortality, fewer children per woman, and higher-income seem to be correlated.\nHowever, we would not want to draw any conclusions before performing formal statistical tests, and investigating the literature to understand if these relationships are also causative.\nIf there were so many categories that the colours become hard to tell apart, it would be worthwhile to try to facet by that dataframe column instead of encoding it as colour."

We will talk more about direct labelling versus legends in a future module, but in general, direct labelling is often clearer.\nWe could combine this strategy by using row and column in facet, which would allow us to create visualizations that split data across three different channels: rows, columns, and colour.\nWhen visualizing so many dataframe columns, it is often useful to use colour for the most important comparison, since these groups will be the closest to each other making them easier to compare.\nIt is not always that simple and in general, you should be careful to avoid creating plots that are so complex that they are hard to interpret."

Later in the course, we will learn about how to visualize missing values to understand if there are patterns in which values are missing, which could affect our data analysis.\nIn this and the previous slide, we can also see that our dataset is pretty big, there are almost 40,000 rows!\nThe first time working with such large datasets in Altair can be a bit confusing because Altair saves the entire dataframe as part of the visualization, when working with pandas dataframes,\nThis is great because each visualization is reproducible in itself, we don’t need to go looking for the data if we come across a plot on the web, or worry that the authors didn’t upload it.\nHowever, for large datasets this causes the visualizations files to become really big, and Altair shows a warning for any dataset larger than 5000 rows.\nWe will talk about this in detail in a later module, and see different strategies for working with large datasets."

Since Altair knows the location of the data online, the chart is still reproducible as long as the data is not removed from its online location.\nThe drawback of not using a dataframe, is that Altair cannot rely on pandas to infer what type of data there is in each column, so we need to help it by indicating the datatype.\nThis is what the :T and :Q after the column names do and an explanation of all the data types in Altair can be found in the next slide."

Because as living conditions improve around the world, child mortality is going down as can be seen in this visualization.\nIn countries where child mortality is high, women will often give birth to more children than they want in order to protect against losing some of their children.\nLower child mortality leads to more predictable family planning, which in turn often leads to smaller families. In the majority of countries where child mortality has been observed to decrease, the number of children per woman has followed and stabilized around two.\nIf you’re interested in knowing more about the world population predictions, you can use Gapminder’s online resources, for example this video on population growh and this one on why it will slow down."

At least the American cars appear to stand out, but it is difficult to see any differences between Europe and Japan.\nVisualizing all data points as in this slide is helpful to detect patterns in the data.\nBut when showing all observations, it can be hard to pick up on general trends in the data, e.g. if there are any differences in the mean weight of cars made in either Japan or Europe.\nTo more effectively visualize such general trends in the data, we can create plots of statistical summaries, such as means and medians.\nIn Altair (and pandas) these are referred to as data aggregations."

Or are you creating a plot to help you understand the structure of your data more in general, such as plotting the distribution of each dataframe column?\nIn either case, it can be extremely helpful to draw out your plot with pen and paper first. This helps you think about if the plot you are creating makes sense or if there is another plot better suited for the task at hand.\nDrawing with pen and paper also makes it easier to write the code afterwards, since you clearly know what you are expecting the visualization to look like."

Can you see the differences in the general trends between these four sets of numbers? This is a slightly modified version of the original, which was put together by statistician Francis Anscombe in the 70s."

A data visualization grammar determines how to combine individual parts of the plotting syntax to create complete visualization.\nIn the example on this slide, you can see that the three bullet points are now broken down into one main function to create the chart linked to the data, and then we build upon this by adding the graphical elements (add_points()) and the encoding of the columns to properties of this chart (encode_columns()).\nBy combining these three grammatical components in different ways, we can build a wide range of visualizations, without memorizing a unique function for each plot type.\nThanks to this grammatical visualization approach, we also only require minimal changes to our code to change the type of plot."

We can use these datasets by importing the data module from the vega_datasets packages as in this slide. Here, our data contains the name of different cars and some attributes relating to each car. There are many interesting questions we could ask from this data set! For our first plot, let’s explore the relationship between how heavy a car is (the Weight_in_lbs column) and how good gas mileage it has (theMiles_per_gallon column).\nBefore starting to code the visualization, take a few seconds and think about what you would expect the relationship between these two columns to look like when you plot it."

This is called a graphical mark in Altair, and in this slide, we have used mark_point() to show the data as points.\nSince we have not specified which columns should be used for the x and y axes, we appear to only see one point in this plot since all the data is plotted on top of each other in the same location.\nTo the right of the chart, there is a button with three dots on it. don’t worry about it right now, we will explain what this is for at the end of the chapter."

These are called axis ticks and help us see where the values of this dataframe column lie along the axis.\nThe faint gray lines are called grid lines and extend the locations of the axis ticks so that it is easy to compare their position to the points.\nThis is particularly useful when the points might be further away from the axis ticks, such as in the next slide."

When we encode a column as the colour channel Altair will automatically figure out an appropriate colour scale to use, depending on whether the data is numerical, categorical, etc. Here we have indicated that we want to colour the points according to the car’s horsepower, which indicated how powerful its engine is.\nWe can see that the heavier cars have more powerful engines, than the lighter ones, but when using colour for a numerical comparison like this, makes it is harder to tell whether the relationship follows a straight line or is of another nature, so this encoding is mostly useful as an approximate indication of the horsepower.\nWe can also observe a relationship between the horsepower of a vehicle and the fuel efficiency. It appears that cars with greater horsepower (the points with a darker shade of blue) are less efficient with their fuel since miles per Gallon is much lower.\nIn the next module, we will learn more in detail about which encodings are most suitable for different comparisons."

In this slide, we instead chose to colour the points per the categorical column Origin (where the car was made).\nAs you can see, Altair detects that this column contains categorical data (with the help of pandas) and picks a different colour scale to facilitate distinction between the categories. As in the previous slide,\nAltair automatically adds a helpful legend, and we can see that the heavier, more powerful cars are primarily manufactured in the US, while the lighter more fuel-efficient ones are manufactured in Europe and Japan (remember that this is true for this particular dataset, and not necessarily all cars)."

We will talk more in-depth about colour theory in a later module."

This representation was also shown to be more effective, as 90% of the low shear stress areas were now correctly identified.\nOverall, these two tweaks more than doubled the outcome accuracy, from 40% to 90%.\nA huge increase from modification that might have seemed to be a mere matter of taste unless you knew visualization theory!\nSo, if anyone tells you that visualization of data is not as important as other components, you can tell them about this study and ask them what kind of visualization they want their doctor to look at when analyzing their arteries."

This is often referred to as estimating the “distribution” of the data, which we will talk more about in the next module.\nThis type of chart is so common that it has its own name: histogram.\nIn our data, we might want to answer the question “How long do people around the world live?” or in other words “What is the distribution of life expectancy for different countries?”.\nIf we create a histogram directly for the numerical values its appearance would be very spiky, as you can see in this slide.\nThis happens because there are very few values that are exactly the same.\nFor example, values like 67.2, 69.3, 69.5, etc, would all get their own bar instead of being in the same bar representing the interval 65-70.\nIf we had ordinal values, such as the numbers on a dice, then it would make sense to have one bar per value on the dice, but in the case of quantitative/continuous data as we have here, this is not a good strategy."

There isn’t really a more informative title we can substitute for here since the length of each bar simply represents the count of observations/records in each bin.\nNow it is easier to see where the life expectancy of the countries fall. We can see that most countries seem to have a life expectancy between 75 and 80 years and that only very few have one under 60. However, these conclusions will depend on exactly how wide our bins are, which we will talk more about in the next module."

We would say that this distribution has a single peak of around 100 min.\nSome distributions have multiple peaks which are not necessarily in the center of the distribution, and some have no distinct peaks at all, but are instead more uniformly distributed.\nWe also see a wide variation in the length of movies in the plot, The shortest movie is just 20-30 min long, while the longest is somewhere between 2010 and 220 minutes.\nI wonder if we can explain some of the variation in the movie runtimes by grouping the data according to one of the categorical columns in the dataset. What do you think, which categories could contribute influence the movie length?"

Because there are so many more movies made in the US compared to the UK, it is quite hard to tell if there are any meaningful differences between movies from the two countries.\nThe location of the two distributions on the x-axis look quite similar, but from these visualizations alone, we don’t have enough information to tell if the location, number of peaks, and the overall shape is the same between the two distributions."

Maybe this means that there is a third group in this data to which all the high values belong too?\nAll this valuable information about our data, is lost when visualizing it as a bar chart. Remember, bar charts are best suited for displaying individual values such as counts, proportions, and sums.\nTo arrive at more accurate conclusions we need to present a richer representation of the data such as a histogram or a density plot, which are great as long as we don’t have too many distributions to compare.\nBut which visualizations could we use to accurately represent the distributions while still remaining effective for comparing many distributions in the same plot?"

In addition to having a robust visualization grammar, it also provides a grammar for interactive features.\nWe will dive deep into more complex interactivity in the last module in this course, but for now, we can simply add a tooltip and answer the question we just posed by hovering with the mouse over the two highest grossing movies. Try it!\n(We need the :N because there are some title values that makes Altair not recognize this dataframe column as nominal otherwise)\nAlthough this visualization is useful in getting information about the individual movies, it is hard to tell exactly how many data points there are in the areas that are completely blue. Is there just enough so that we don’t see any of the white background or are there thousands of observations stacked on top of each other?\nThis plot is saturated, something we will discuss in detail in the next module. We could use transparency to alleviate this issue to some extend, but it is more effective to use colour for representing the counts, such as in a heatmap."

    "text": "Boxplots show several key statistics from a distribution\nJhguch at en.wikipedia via Wikimedia Commons\n \n\n\nA boxplot is a mix between showing individual values and a few key summary statistics.\nInstead of showing just the mean or median as with a bar plot, a box plot shows 5 summary statistics.\nThe box represents three values, the median in the middle and the lower and upper quartile at the edges This means that 50% of the data points lie within the box.\nThe lines extending from the box are called whiskers and they can represent a few different statistics. Sometimes, they are showing the min and the max (the range) of our data.\nHowever, it is more common that they show the furthest points that are still within 1.5 x the “interquartile” range from the edges of the box. The interquartile range is the distance between the edges of the box.\nConventionally, any observations that fall outside the whiskers, are drawn out as individual points and are sometimes referred to as “outliers”, which are occasionally discarded.\nHowever, what really is an outlier in your data and what you should do with them depends on the question you are asking. Maybe these data points are the most important in your dataset or they could be measurement errors. You should always look further and think carefully before discarding data as outliers.\nHow does it look when we use boxplots to answer our question?"

We can ensure ourselves that the distributions are roughly the same shape and view potential outliers.\nWe can directly answer the question we posed at the beginning: the Adventure genre generates the highest revenue both in terms of the medians and the overall position of the boxes.\nIt seems like Action is the second most highly grossing genre, but after that, it becomes hard to compare. We could make this visualization even more effective by sorting the boxes according to their median value."

It is easy to compare genres with similar grossing since they are right next to each other in the plot.\nIf we wanted to look closer at the differences between the bulk of the distributions we could exclude the two most highly grossing movies."

This can be seen in the animation in this slide, where variation in the raw data does no result in any change in the boxplots.\nTwo effective visualizations for many distributions that also handle multiple peaks are violin plots (as shown in this slide) and stripplots.\nViolinplots are similar to density plots put next to each other, and stripplots prevent overlap by distributing the points in a cloud instead of a straight line.\nThere are also sina plots, which combine the best of violin plots and strip plots together.\nThese are all highly effective, but not yet available to make easily in Altair, so we will not be teaching them here.\nBoxplots are still very effective in comparing multiple distributions, and when there are even more distributions than what we have here, e.g. 50+, then boxplots are often easier to interpret than the alternatives mentions above, since they are simpler."

Sorting the chart in an intuitive order has once again shown to be crucial for making our plot easier to interpret.\nIn a normalized stacked bar chart it makes sense to sort by either the first or the last coloured segment. Since not all genres have movies rated 'G', we chose to set the order based on 'R' instead.\nIf you are more interested in one genre than others, you could also choose to sort by that genre.\nNow we can directly compare the length of individual bar segments between the genres. We see that there certainly are differences in the proportions of MPAA ratings between movies in different genres.\nFor the R rating, it is immediately obvious exactly how big these differences are, and we can see that all black comedies are rated R, while almost no adventure movies receive this rating.\nIt is a little bit harder to compare the other rating because the coloured segments do not share the same baseline. We can still see that concerts and performance movies has the highest proportions of movies that are kids-friendly at 50%, while musicals, documentaries, and action movies have around 20% kids-friendly movies.\n(We specified the sort order manually in this slide, because it is rather advanced to extract this order using pandas, but we include an example in the transcript if you are interested in how this could be done:)\nsort_order = (\n    movies_extended\n    .groupby('Major Genre')['MPAA Rating']\n    .value_counts(normalize=True)\n    .xs('R', level='MPAA Rating')\n    .sort_values()\n    .index\n    .to_list())"

We saw in the last slide that it was a bit harder to compare the coloured segments that did not share a baseline versus the segments at the ends where the baseline is the same.\nThis means that normalized stacked bar charts are ideal when there are only two categories, since both segments will be easy to compare between categories.\nWe can see an example in this slide where we filtered the dataset to contain only movies rated either 'G' or 'PG'. It is easy to make a comparison for both the blue and the orange segments.\nStacked bar charts also work fine for 3-4 categories, but beyond that, they are usually ineffective. Even for 3-4 categories, it is often preferred to show the bars side-by-side instead of stacked."

You will learn more about customizing elements such as titles in the next module.\nBy resolving the x-scale to be independent between the plots, the bar height is not relative to the max in each facet. This makes them easier to compare as proportions both within and between facets while still retaining an indication of the count on the x-axis.\nIf we wanted to compare the absolute counts between facets, we would leave the axis at its default value: “shared”.\nThis type of visualization is effective when we want to accurately compare the heights of bars within a genre. For example, to answer the question: “Which are the most common MPAA ratings for each genre?”."

It is important to remember that genres have more movies in total, so, we would expect them to show up highly in all the facets.

In this heatmap the colour represents the combinatorial counts of two categorical columns, such as how many movies are both rated G and in the comedy genre.\nComparing squares vertically in this heatmap is similar to the first faceted plot we made and comparing them horizontally is similar to the faceted visualization in the last slide.\nIn other words, if we want to compare which genre is most common for a certain rating, we compare the colours column-wise in the heatmap. If we instead are interested in the most common rating assigned to a movie we compare the columns row-wise. We can quickly see that most dramas are rated PG-13 or R and most horror movies are rated R.\nSorting on colour/count puts the genres with many observations close together, similar to how we sorted on 'x' and 'y' in previous modules. We could sort the x-axis also, but since it has a natural order to it, we have decided to keep it as is here.\nThis visualization is effective for quickly communicating the main takeaways from the two questions and giving us an overview of the data, but it is harder to tell that exact count for each colour so, if that is of great importance a bar chart is more suitable."

Failing to account for this would lead to less accurate and possibly misleading results.\nAs for the numerical columns above, we start by printing information about the most frequently occurring categorical values in each of the columns.
